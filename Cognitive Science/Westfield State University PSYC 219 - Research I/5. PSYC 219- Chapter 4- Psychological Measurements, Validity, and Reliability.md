### I. Psychological Measurement
#### A. Introduction to Operational Definitions

Measuring behavior in psychology can be challenging, especially when dealing with abstract concepts like anxiety. Unlike physical measurements, which can be quantified using a ruler, psychological measurements require careful consideration of how and why certain behaviors are being measured. **Operational definitions** play a crucial role in this process by turning abstract ideas into measurable constructs.

An operational definition is a way of defining something so that it can be used in research, making it empirical and observable. By using operational definitions, researchers can remove subjectivity and bias from their measurements. For example, measuring car ownership can be done by asking people on a questionnaire whether they own a car. Another example is measuring expressing gratitude to a romantic partner by rating how often someone tells their partner that they're the best on a seven-point scale.

The type of story told about a scientist can also be operationalized as an independent variable, where different stories are presented to participants. Regardless of the behavior being studied, it's essential to choose an operational definition that is clear and accurate, and there may be multiple ways to do so.

#### B. Measurement Scales

Understanding how to compare data effectively requires knowledge of measurement scales. There are four main types:

*   **Nominal scale**: Categorizes data without any quantitative value, such as favorite sports teams or species.
*   **Ordinal scale**: Ranks data but doesn't provide equal intervals between values, like first place versus second place in a race.
*   **Interval scale**: Has equal intervals between values but lacks a true zero point, exemplified by temperature measurements in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
*   **Ratio scale**: Possesses both equal intervals and a true zero point, making it the most advanced scale, as seen with exam scores.

#### C. Measurement Methods

There are four types of measurement methods:

*   **Self-report**: Involves asking individuals about their behavior or attitudes directly, which can be cheap but may lead to biased responses due to social desirability.
*   **Testing**: Measures involve standardized tests designed to identify individual differences in behavior, such as IQ exams.
*   **Behavioral measures**: Observe outward explicit responses, like counting the number of sodas someone consumes each morning.
*   **Physiological measures**: Examine bodily activity, such as heart rate or brain scans.

### II. Reliability and Validity
#### A. Introduction to Reliability

Reliability is a key concept in measurement, referring to how consistent a measurement is over time and across different contexts. A reliable measurement produces the same result consistently, making it essential for accurate research findings.

There are several types of reliability:

*   **Test-retest ability**: Involves re-running an experiment with the same participants to ensure consistency.
*   **Inter-rater reliability**: Where multiple people grade or measure the same thing, and if they come to an agreement, that's good; but if they don't, it means there's a problem with the measurement.
*   **Scatter plots**: Can be used to assess reliability by looking at the correlation between two variables.

#### B. Introduction to Validity

Validity refers to how accurately a test measures what it claims to measure. There are several types of validity:

*   **Face validity**: Whether the measurement looks like what it's supposed to be measuring.
*   **Content validity**: Whether the measurement assesses all aspects of that behavior.
*   **Criterion validity**: How well the measurement predicts an outcome.
*   **Construct validity**: The extent to which the measurement reflects the theoretical construct it's supposed to measure.
*   **Discriminant validity**: Whether the measurement differentiates between related but separate constructs.

For instance, measuring depression and anxiety can be tricky because they often occur together, so a question that measures both would have bad discriminant validity.
