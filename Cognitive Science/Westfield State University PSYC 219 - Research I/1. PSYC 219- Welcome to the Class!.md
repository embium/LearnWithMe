### I. Course Overview
#### A. Introduction to Research Methods 1

Welcome to Research Methods 1, an online asynchronous class designed to introduce you to the basics of research methods in psychology. This course is a crucial part of your major and will cover various aspects of research methods, including how to ask questions about human behavior, understand what we observe, and predict future behavior.

Research is formalized curiosity - it's about asking questions and seeking answers with a purpose. Throughout the semester, we'll explore this topic in-depth, learning how to separate truth from fiction and misinformation, conduct literature reviews, design studies, and communicate ideas clearly and effectively.

#### B. Learning Objectives

The course is structured around eight learning objectives, which are outlined in the syllabus on Plato:

1.  **Understanding Psychology as a Science**: Learn about the scientific method and its application in psychology.
2.  **Using Psychological Measurements**: Understand various methods of measuring psychological phenomena.
3.  **Experimental Designs**: Know the difference between subjects and within-subjects experimental designs, interpret factorial experimental designs, conduct correlational designs, and understand other research methodologies.
4.  **Conducting Literature Reviews**: Learn how to search for and critically evaluate existing research on a topic.
5.  **Designing Studies**: Understand how to design studies that are effective in answering research questions.
6.  **Communicating Ideas Clearly**: Develop skills to communicate research findings effectively through various mediums.

### II. Course Structure
#### A. Grading Opportunities

Throughout the semester, you'll have multiple grading opportunities through assignments, quizzes, and discussions. The assignments will be due on Sundays at 11:59 PM, and there will be two exams that account for 10% of your final grade each. Quizzes will cover a chapter each week, and discussions will involve responding to research articles and engaging with classmates' posts.

#### B. Assignments and Deadlines

-   **Assignments**: Typically available two weeks in advance.
-   **Quizzes**: Covering one chapter per week.
-   **Discussions**: Involving responses to research articles and engagement with classmates' posts.

### III. Success Strategies
#### A. Preparing for Class

To succeed in this class, it's essential to:

1.  Read the textbook before watching lecture videos or taking quizzes.
2.  Take notes on the material for discussion and quiz preparation.
3.  Have the article with you during the quiz.

#### B. Additional Resources

You'll have access to office hours via Zoom, where you can meet with me to discuss any questions or concerns. I encourage you to take advantage of these opportunities to ensure your success in the course.

### IV. Important Policies
#### A. Accommodations and Makeups

If you require accommodations through the Disability Center, please let me know. There are no makeups in this class, so if you miss something, it's considered incomplete.

#### B. Plagiarism Policy

Zero tolerance applies to plagiarism; I had to fail two students last semester due to shared responses passed off as their own work. If you're concerned about plagiarism, email me or cite your sources. We'll discuss the importance of citing sources and transparency throughout the semester.

### V. Course Calendar and Resources
#### A. Accessing Course Materials

The course calendar and assignment deadlines can be found on the left side of the platform. Starting in week four, we'll have research articles and quizzes. You can find lecture slides, the online ebook, and other resources on Plato.

#### B. Lecture Videos and Support

I'll record lecture videos for each chapter, which will walk through the lecture slides and explain their significance. The syllabus and rubrics section will be updated soon; you can also find them in the course materials.

### VI. Staying Engaged
#### A. Discussion Prompt

For the first week, focus on an introductory discussion prompt available on Plato.
