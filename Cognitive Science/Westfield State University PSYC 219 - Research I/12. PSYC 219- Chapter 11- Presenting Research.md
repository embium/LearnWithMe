### I. Presenting Research
#### A. Overview of APA Style

Chapter 11 focuses on presenting research using the American Psychological Association (APA) style, a format commonly used in science disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and biology. Unlike MLA and Chicago styles, APA style has distinct guidelines for organizing research papers to ensure clarity and objectivity.

#### B. Structure of an APA-Style Paper

An APA-style paper consists of several sections:

*   **Abstract**: A brief summary (150-250 words) that provides an overview of the research.
*   **Introduction**: An introduction that sets up the research question, explains its importance, and highlights relevant background information.
*   **Method Section**: A detailed description of the research design, procedures, and participants.
*   **Results**: Presentation of the data collected, often in tables or figures.
*   **Discussion**: Interpretation of the results, including implications and limitations.
*   **References**: A list of sources cited in the paper, formatted according to APA style.
*   **Tables/Figures**: Visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, or images.

Each section has specific guidelines to ensure clarity and objectivity. Researchers should avoid direct quotations, personal attacks on other researchers' work, and biased language.

#### C. Guidelines for Writing Research Papers

When writing research papers, consider the following:

*   **Avoid Direct Quotations**: Instead of quoting others directly, paraphrase or summarize their ideas.
*   **Personal Attacks**: Refrain from making personal attacks on other researchers' work or opinions.
*   **Biased Language**: Use objective language to present data and avoid emotional appeals.

#### D. Grammar and Punctuation

Grammar and punctuation are essential in research writing:

*   **"That" vs. "Which"**: Use "that" when referring to a specific person or thing, and use "which" when describing something more general.
*   **Data and Datum**: Data is plural, but datum refers to one piece of data.
*   **Fewer and Less**: Use "fewer" for items that can be counted (e.g., 12 items or fewer) and "less" for measurements (e.g., less Coca-Cola than my brother did).
*   **Effect and Affect**: Effect is a noun, while affect is a verb. If the starting vowel is an "e," use effect; if it's an "a," use affect.

#### E. Research Proposals

Research proposals typically have three sections:

1.  **Introduction**: Define the research question, explain its importance, and highlight relevant background information.
2.  **Methods**: Outline step-by-step what you'll do to collect data.
3.  **Expectations**: State your expectations based on your hypotheses.

#### F. Presenting Research Orally

When presenting research orally, consider using poster presentations, which are popular and allow you to summarize your findings on one slide.

#### G. Conclusion

Presenting research in APA style is essential for clarity and objectivity. By following the guidelines outlined above, researchers can ensure that their work is presented accurately and effectively.
