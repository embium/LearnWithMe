### I. Introduction to Research Methods
#### A. Understanding How We Know What We Know

Welcome to our first chapter on research methods, where we'll explore how we know what we know in science and psychology. This introductory chapter sets the stage for integrating scientific principles with psychological concepts. You may have been exposed to some of this material before, but we'll delve deeper into these ideas throughout the course.

Our goal is to understand different areas of psychological research, including where knowledge comes from, and how we can critically evaluate evidence. We'll examine various sources of knowledge, such as experience, intuition, and research itself, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

#### B. Sources of Knowledge

There are several sources of knowledge that we rely on in our daily lives:

*   **Experience**: While valuable, experience often lacks control or comparison groups, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions.
*   **Intuition**: Our gut instincts may not always align with reality, and intuition can be misleading if not based on empirical evidence.
*   **Research**: Provides a systematic approach to understanding human behavior and psychology, offering a more reliable source of knowledge.

#### C. The Importance of Critical Evaluation

It's essential to critically evaluate evidence from various sources, considering both the strengths and limitations of each. This involves recognizing our own biases and being willing to consider alternative explanations.

### II. The Scientific Method
#### A. Empirical Evidence and Falsifiability

Science relies on empirical evidence and falsifiability, meaning that theories must be testable and open to revision or rejection based on new data. This approach is essential for advancing knowledge and avoiding pseudoscientific claims.

*   **Empirical Evidence**: Based on observation and experience, rather than personal opinions or biases.
*   **Falsifiability**: Theories must be testable and open to revision or rejection based on new data.

#### B. Ruling Out Impossible Explanations

The key to effective investigation is ruling out impossible explanations, no matter how convincing the evidence may seem. This principle is essential in the justice system, where alibis and evidence are used to eliminate suspects rather than point fingers.

### III. Types of Research
#### A. Basic Research

Basic research seeks to understand fundamental principles, such as how human behavior works. It often paves the way for applied research, which aims to apply these findings to real-world problems.

*   **Basic Research**: Focuses on understanding fundamental principles and mechanisms.
*   **Applied Research**: Applies basic research findings to real-world problems and challenges.

#### B. Goals of Science in Psychology

The goals of science in psychology and other disciplines are to describe, explain, and predict human behavior. This involves understanding why certain behaviors occur and being able to make accurate predictions based on available data.

*   **Description**: Accurately describing human behavior and phenomena.
*   **Explanation**: Understanding the underlying mechanisms and causes of human behavior.
*   **Prediction**: Making accurate predictions about future behavior based on available data.
