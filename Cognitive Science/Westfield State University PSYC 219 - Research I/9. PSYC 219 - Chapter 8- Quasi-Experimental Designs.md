### I. Quasi-Experimental Designs
#### A. Overview of Quasi-Experimental Designs

Quasi-experimental designs are a type of research study that combines elements of correlational studies and experimental designs. They're often used when it's not possible to randomly assign participants to different groups or conditions. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the independent variable is determined by some other factor before the study begins, rather than being manipulated by the researcher.

#### B. Characteristics of Quasi-Experimental Designs

In quasi-experiments, the independent variable is not controlled by the researcher but is instead influenced by external factors. For instance, a study might compare individuals who have undergone cosmetic surgery with those who haven't, without randomly assigning participants to these groups. This type of design can be beneficial for assessing causality and directionality but is more susceptible to confounding variables that can impact the results.

#### C. Threats to Internal Validity in Quasi-Experiments

Quasi-experimental designs are vulnerable to several threats to internal validity, including:

*   **Selection effects**: Pre-existing differences between participants are not accounted for.
*   **Maturation threats**: Participants naturally change over time.
*   **History threats**: Real-world events or trends influence behavior.

#### D. Types of Quasi-Experimental Designs

Quasi-experimental designs can be further divided into two types:

1.  **Single-group designs**: A single group of participants undergoes some treatment or experiences an event.
2.  **Non-equivalent groups designs**: Two or more groups are compared, but they are not equivalent in terms of their characteristics.

#### E. Real-World Applications and Considerations

Quasi-experimental designs can be useful for assessing causality and directionality in real-world settings. However, it's essential to consider the potential limitations and threats to internal validity when designing and interpreting these studies.

### V. Inviting Viewers to Participate
#### A. Overview of Inviting Viewers to Participate

The speaker invites viewers to suggest rewards for participating in future videos.

#### B. Potential Rewards and Incentives

*   **Extra credit**: Participants may receive extra credit for their involvement.
*   **Incentives**: Other incentives, such as gifts or recognition, might be offered to encourage participation.

#### C. Real-World Applications and Considerations

Inviting viewers to participate in future videos can be a great way to engage with the audience and build a sense of community around the content being created.
