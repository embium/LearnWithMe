### I. Small End Designs: Understanding Human Behavior through In-Depth Studies
#### A. Overview of Small End Designs

Small end designs, also known as single subject designs, are a research approach that focuses on studying a single individual or a small group to gain insights into human behavior. Unlike large-scale studies that aim to generalize findings across populations, small end designs prioritize understanding the unique characteristics and experiences of an individual or a small group. This approach is particularly useful when working with rare populations, such as individuals with neurological disorders or developmental disabilities.

#### B. Key Features of Small End Designs

- **Focus on Individual Differences**: Small end designs assume that individual differences are important and that studying consistent effects in real-time can reveal biological and social patterns that might be missed in traditional group studies.
- **In-Depth Analysis**: By focusing on a single subject or small group, researchers can identify patterns and relationships that might be overlooked in larger studies.
- **Real-Time Observations**: Small end designs involve observing and recording behavior as it occurs, allowing researchers to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior.

#### C. Examples of Small End Designs

- **Henry Malaysian's Case Study on Memory Loss**: Henry Malaysian's case study provided valuable insights into the workings of human memory.
- **Ted Bundy's Interviews**: Ted Bundy's interviews helped researchers understand the motivations behind his heinous crimes.
- **Jean Piaget's Work on Child Development**: Jean Piaget's work involved following individual children to understand their cognitive and social growth.

#### D. Applications in Applied Behavior Analysis

Small end designs have been used in applied behavior analysis, where researchers design treatment plans for individuals with specific needs, such as:
- Overcoming dog phobia
- Learning conservation of matter
By focusing on the unique experiences and behaviors of individual subjects, small end designs offer a valuable complement to larger-scale research methods.

#### E. Single-Subject Research Designs

The lecture discussed various single-subject research designs used in applied behavior analysis, including:
- **Reversal Designs**: Reversal designs allow researchers to control for confounding variables and draw more confident conclusions about the effectiveness of a treatment.
- **Multiple Baseline Designs**: Multiple baseline designs also enable researchers to control for confounding variables and increase confidence in their findings.

#### F. Validity in Single-Subject Research

The lecture emphasized that single-subject research can have high internal validity but may struggle with external validity due to its focus on individual participants rather than groups. The concepts of:
- **Internal Validity**: Refers to the extent to which a study's design and procedures minimize threats to its internal validity.
- **External Validity**: Refers to the extent to which a study's findings can be generalized to other populations or settings.
- **Social Validity**: Refers to the degree to which a treatment is perceived as socially acceptable by participants, researchers, and stakeholders.
- **Statistical Validity**: Refers to the accuracy of statistical analyses used in research.

#### G. Conclusion

Small end designs offer a valuable approach for understanding human behavior through in-depth studies of individual subjects or small groups. By focusing on unique characteristics and experiences, these approaches can reveal patterns and relationships that might be overlooked in larger studies.
