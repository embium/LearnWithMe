### I. Homework Assignment Overview
#### A. Reviewing Brain Structures and Functions

The instructor has assigned a homework review to help students practice their understanding of various brain structures and functions. This assignment includes worksheets with diagrams and questions that will be posted online after class. The goal is not just to memorize the material, but to understand the concepts and relationships between different brain regions.

#### B. Importance of Understanding Brain Structures

Understanding brain structures and functions is crucial for students to grasp more advanced concepts in neuroscience. This homework assignment serves as a review and practice opportunity for students to solidify their knowledge and prepare for upcoming exams or quizzes.

### II. Red Nucleus Overview
#### A. Anatomy and Function

The red nucleus is a structure involved in motor control, located in the midbrain. It receives inputs from various brain regions and sends outputs to other areas, playing a crucial role in coordinating movements.

#### B. Outputs and Connections

The red nucleus has connections with other brain regions, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and spinal cord. These connections enable it to influence motor functions, such as movement planning and execution.

### III. Interneurons Overview
#### A. Definition and Role

Interneurons are a type of neuron that connects with motor neurons, facilitating communication between different brain regions involved in motor control. They play a crucial role in integrating sensory information and motor responses.

### IV. Descending Pathways Overview
#### A. Three Main Pathways

There are three main descending pathways from the cortex to motor neurons:

1. **Corticospinal tract**: Originates from the primary motor cortex, responsible for voluntary movements.
2. **Lateral brainstem pathway**: Involved in motor control and coordination.
3. **Medial brainstem pathway**: Plays a role in regulating motor functions, including spinal reflexes.

#### B. Study by Lawrence and Kypers

Researchers made lesions in monkeys to understand the function of these descending pathways. They found that bilateral lesions had more drastic effects on motor functions than unilateral lesions. The study also showed that the paramedian tract degenerates after an earlier lesion, but cutting all medial pathways still allows some lateral dominance in brain function.

### V. Motor Cortex Overview
#### A. Location and Function

The motor cortex is responsible for planning and executing voluntary movements. It receives inputs from various sensory areas and sends outputs to motor neurons through descending pathways.

#### B. Giant Pyramidal Cells (Betz cells)

Giant pyramidal cells, also known as Betz cells, are a type of neuron found in the motor cortex. They give rise to long axons that descend to the spinal cord, playing a crucial role in motor control.

### VI. Effects of Lesions on Motor Functions
#### A. Human vs. Monkey Studies

Studies have shown that lesions in humans result in permanent disruption of motor functions, including spinal reflexes, speed, and strength. In contrast, monkeys recover some motor abilities but not full coordination or separation of digit control.

#### B. Unlearned Movements and Fixed Action Patterns

A study on hamsters found that unlearned movements, such as seed-shelling, are preserved even after paramedian tract damage, suggesting a fixed action pattern. This highlights the importance of understanding the neural basis of motor functions and how they differ between species.

#### C. Vestibular-Spinal Tract and Lateral Pathway Damage

Damage to the vestibular-spinal tract results in stumbling and difficulty controlling body movements. In contrast, lateral pathway damage leads to loss of motor functions, including speed and strength, which will be discussed further in a subsequent class.
