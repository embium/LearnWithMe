### I. Introduction to the Hippocampal Formation
#### A. Overview of the Hippocampal Formation's Role in Spatial Memory and Play Cells

The hippocampal formation is a critical brain structure responsible for spatial memory, play cells, and head direction cells. These functional topics will be explored in detail, including synaptic change, information storage, and neurotransmitters involved.

#### B. Key Concepts: Play Cells and Head Direction Cells

Play cells are active when an animal is at a specific location, while head direction cells signal changes in head direction. These definitions were established by electrophysiologists to understand the distinct roles of these cell types within the hippocampal formation.

### II. Sub-Regions of the Hippocampus
#### A. Dorsal and Ventral Hippocampus: Distinct Connections

The hippocampus has two main sub-regions: dorsal and ventral, with distinct connections to the amygdala and other structures. This dichotomy is essential for understanding the complex relationships between the hippocampus and other brain regions.

#### B. Medial Pallium and Its Projections

The medial pallium, which includes the hippocampus, projects to the ventral striatum and hypothalamus, associating place with good or bad consequences. This connection highlights the critical role of the hippocampus in integrating spatial information with emotional experiences.

### III. The Hippocampal Formation's Connections to Other Brain Structures
#### A. Perforant Pathway: A Major Input Pathway

The perforant path, a major input pathway to the mammalian hippocampus, originates from the entorhinal cortex and connects through the dentate gyrus to CA3 neurons, which then project to CA1 cells. This circuit is essential for long-term potentiation, a process that can be induced by rapidly stimulating the pathway.

#### B. Connections with the Subiculum

Recent studies have revealed additional connections between the hippocampus and other brain areas, including the subiculum, which provides the majority of output axons to the mamillary bodies. These findings challenge traditional textbook diagrams that show direct connections between the hippocampus and certain brain regions.

### IV. Neurotransmitters and Modulators Involved in Hippocampal Function
#### A. Acetylcholine: A Key Neurotransmitter

The hippocampus is connected to the septal area through a pathway that uses acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, and this connection is essential for memory formation.

#### B. Cortisol and Sleep Stages

Levels of certain modulators, such as cortisol, change during different stages of sleep, including slow-wave sleep, which may be critical for memory consolidation. The hippocampus itself does not have the capacity to retain all long-term memories but serves as a temporary storage site that transfers information to the neocortex for permanent storage.

### V. Adult Plasticity and Synaptic Changes in the Hippocampus
#### A. Collateral Sprouting of Axons

The hippocampus exhibits dramatic adult plasticity, including collateral sprouting of axons, which can occur in response to lesions or other changes in brain function. This plasticity is not limited to anatomical changes but also involves synaptic changes that are thought to be involved in memory consolidation.

#### B. Synaptic Changes and Memory Consolidation

Synaptic changes within the hippocampus play a critical role in memory consolidation, allowing for the transfer of information from temporary storage sites to permanent storage locations in the neocortex.
