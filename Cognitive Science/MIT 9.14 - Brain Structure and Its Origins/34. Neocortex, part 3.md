### I. Introduction to the Neocortex
#### A. Overview of the Neocortex Structure

The neocortex is a complex structure that can be divided into different regions based on cytoarchitecture, connections, and function. It is a critical component of the brain responsible for various higher-order cognitive processes, including sensory perception, motor control, and executive functions.

#### B. Cytoarchitectural Classification

The neocortex can be broadly categorized into three types: neocortex, allocortex, and transitional areas. Within these categories, there are different regions, including Brodmann areas, which are defined by cytoarchitecture and connections. These regions have distinct cellular structures and patterns of connectivity that underlie their specific functions.

### II. Radial Fascicles in the Neocortex
#### A. Definition and Function

Radial fascicles in the neocortex are composed of axons terminating in all layers, especially layer four, with outputs to the brainstem, thalamus, and other cortical areas. These axons include phalocortical fibers, which terminate in layer four and have outputs to various regions.

#### B. The Line of Gennari

The line of Gennari is a historical reference point that highlights the transverse group of axons seen in radial fascicles. This feature is an important anatomical landmark for identifying radial fascicles in the neocortex.

### III. Intra-Columnar Axons and Radial Fascicles
#### A. Definition and Characteristics

In contrast to intra-columnar axons, which are not typically found in radial fascicles but rather in areas with little myelin, radial fascicles contain a specific type of axon that is characteristic of these structures.

### IV. Cortical Regions and Their Functions
#### A. Brodmann Areas

The neocortex can be broadly categorized into different regions, including Brodmann areas, which are defined by cytoarchitecture and connections. These regions have distinct functional profiles, ranging from primary sensory and motor areas to higher-order association cortices.

#### B. Functional Differences Between Cortical Regions

Functional differences between cortical regions have been studied using various methods, including electrophysiology, stimulation, recording, lesions, and functional imaging techniques such as PET scanning and magnetic resonance imaging.

### V. Expansion of the Neocortex in Primates
#### A. Temporalization and Visual Processing

The neocortex has undergone significant expansion in primates, particularly in the temporal lobe, which is known as temporalization. This expansion has led to the development of new cortical areas, including those involved in visual processing.

### VI. Cortical Projections and Connections
#### A. Major Palus Cortical Projections

The major palus cortical projections include the geniculate bodies, lateral palus, ventral palus, medial dorsal nucleus, anterior nuclei, intralaminar, and midline structures. These regions project to various areas of the neocortex, including central cortex, which is responsible for sensory-motor functions.

#### B. Thalamic Projections

The thalamus is divided into several nuclei, with the ventral anterior (VA) nucleus receiving direct sensory input from the spinothalamic tract and medial lemniscus. The VA projects to the motor cortex, primarily the primary motor area, which receives heavy inputs from the cerebellum, globus pallidus, and putamen.

### VII. Association Cortices and Executive Functions
#### A. Prefrontal Areas and Association Cortices

The prefrontal areas and association cortices are involved in executive functions such as decision-making and planning. These regions receive projections from various thalamic nuclei, including the medial dorsal nucleus (MD), which also projects to prefrontal areas.

### VIII. Developmental Changes in Cortical Connections
#### A. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Studies

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method used to verify connections in the human brain. DTI studies have shown developmental changes in fibers that come into the Broca's region of the frontal lobe, which is important for speaking.

### IX. Higher-Order Processing and Association Layers
#### A. Transcortical Projections and Callosal Fibers

The association layers of neocortex, particularly layers 2 and 3, give rise to transcortical projections and callosal fibers. These superficial layers are unique to mammals and are involved in higher-order processing.
