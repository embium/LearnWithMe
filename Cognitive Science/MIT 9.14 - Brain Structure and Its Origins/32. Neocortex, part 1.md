### I. Class Schedule and Assignments
#### A. Upcoming Assessments

- There will be no quiz today or on Friday.
- A homework assignment consisting of eight questions will be posted and is due on Friday.
- The homework includes six written questions, with extra credit available for additional questions if time permits.

#### B. Homework Details

*   The homework assignment will cover material from previous sessions.
*   Students are expected to complete the assigned questions and any additional ones they can fit in within the given timeframe.

### II. Neurogenesis and Brain Development
#### A. Introduction to Neurogenesis

- Research has shown that new neurons are generated in certain areas of the adult brain, including the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.
- The turnover rate for these new neurons is approximately 40 days.
- Lower levels of neurogenesis have been observed in other areas, such as the neocortex.

#### B. Functions of New Neurons

*   The function of new neurons in the hippocampus is still unknown, except for their role in this region.
*   Studies have shown that environmental enrichment can increase neurogenesis in rats, while stress can decrease it.

### III. Evolution and Function of End Brain Structures
#### A. Overview of End Brain Structures

- The class will discuss the evolution and functions of end brain structures, including the neocortex.
- The neocortex evolved from the dorsal cortex of ancestral vertebrates.
- Other structures to be discussed include the amygdala, which is a single structure in terms of function despite complex gene expression patterns.

#### B. Types of Learning

*   Two major types of learning are sensory-motor habits and spatial learning.
*   Spatial learning is more important for evolution.

### IV. Cortical Areas and Functions
#### A. Overview of Cortical Areas

- The cortex can be divided into different regions, each with distinct characteristics and functions.
- Sensory cortex areas devoted to high-acuity senses such as vision and touch are larger than those for lower-acuity senses.

#### B. Motor Acuity and Cortical Representation

*   Motor acuity varies across different body parts, with areas controlling fine movements having more cortical representation.
*   The primary motor cortex is specialized for controlling fine movements and receives some sensory input.

#### C. Paralimbic Cortical Areas

- These areas play a crucial role in processing sensory information and are divided into two main regions: place sense and object sense.
- They connect to the hippocampus and other structures involved in memory formation and emotional responses.

#### D. Prefrontal Cortex and Executive Functions

*   The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions such as anticipation, planning, and working memory.
*   These functions are essential for human behavior and also important in animals.
