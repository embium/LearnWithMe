### I. The Evolution of the Neocortex
#### A. Overview of Cortical Development

The neocortex is a complex structure that has evolved over time, with different types of functions emerging as it developed. This process involved the expansion of individual areas, the multiplication of different representations of the same sensory surface, and the specialization of existing ones. The major types of functions in the neocortex include location sense, object sense, and prefrontal laborations of motor cortex for planning.

#### B. The Role of the Campus System

The campus system plays a crucial role in facilitating anticipation of stimuli and memory recall. This system enables the anticipation of future events and facilitates decision-making based on motivation. The hippocampus is particularly important in this process, as it receives information from other areas and uses it to call up relevant memories.

#### C. Association Areas and Anticipatory Activity

In contrast to the campus system, parietal and temporal association areas are involved in anticipatory activity, such as planning movements and other types of anticipation. These areas work together with other parts of the brain to enable complex behaviors and decision-making processes.

### II. Cortical Expansion and Specialization
#### A. Early Parcellation and Olfactory Cortex

The earliest parcellation of the neocortex was the separation of olfactory inputs from non-olfactory areas. The olfactory cortex, which receives direct input from the olfactory bulbs, is distinct from other sensory areas.

#### B. Multimodal Association Areas

Multimodal association areas are thought to be among the oldest types of cortex but have expanded relatively recently in humans. These areas integrate information from multiple senses and play a crucial role in higher-order cognitive processes.

#### C. Visual System Development

The visual system shows a V1 and V2 area in all animals studied, with varying numbers of additional visual areas present in larger primates. The expansion of the visual system has allowed for greater complexity and nuance in visual perception.

### III. Cortical Structure and Cell Types
#### A. Layered Organization

The neocortex is composed of six distinct layers, each with unique cell types and functions. These layers include layer five, which contains pyramidal cells that project to various areas, including the spinal cord, brain stem, thalamus, and other parts of the cortex.

#### B. Cell Types and Their Functions

Different cell types exist in the neocortex, including pyramidal cells with apical dendrites and stellate cells without apical dendrites. These cells can be classified based on structure, neurotransmitters, or other criteria. Inhibitory interneurons also have distinct shapes and axonal distributions, forming local connections within columns or between nearby columns.

#### C. Anatomical and Electrophysiological Methods

Anatomical methods, such as the Golgi method and fiber stains, have been used to study cortical layers and columns. Electrophysiology has provided functional definitions of these structures based on differences in cell responses. Molecular methods have also been employed to identify specific layers and cell types.

### IV. Conclusion
The evolution of the neocortex is a complex process that has involved the expansion and specialization of individual areas, as well as the development of new sensory areas. Understanding this process can provide valuable insights into the workings of the human brain and its many functions.
