### I. The Visual System's Expansion into the End Brain
#### A. Overview of Visual Pathways

The invasion of the end brain by visual pathways is a complex process that has evolved over time. Initially, there was a small direct pathway through the geniculate body, but major roots into the end brain developed from the tectum and pretectal area. This expansion provided better information to the striatum, enabling higher acuity for learning, especially through pathways to the hippocampal formation and amygdala.

#### B. Development of Visual Pathways

The development of visual pathways involved the growth of several key structures:

*   **Tectum and Pretectal Area**: These areas projected to thalamic areas that then projected to the end brain.
*   **Thalamus**: The dorsal thalamus projects to the cortex, while the ventral thalamus (subthalamus) has different functions.
*   **Epithalamus**: This structure receives retinal projections and is distinct from other areas.

#### C. Species-Specific Variations

The visual system's expansion into the end brain varies among species:

*   **Humans and Monkeys**: The lateral posterior nucleus grows significantly and changes name, becoming part of the pulvinar.
*   **Rodents**: The geniculate body has four layers compared to six in humans and monkeys.

#### D. Accessory Optic Tract

The accessory optic tract is a system that provides visual information, particularly movement detection:

*   **Function**: This tract branches off from the main optic tract and terminates in small cell groups.
*   **Response**: The cells respond to movement of the whole visual scene across the retina, regardless of location.

#### E. Key Structures

Some key structures involved in the visual system's expansion into the end brain include:

*   **Geniculate Body**: This structure has a horseshoe shape due to the growth of the pulvinar and thalamus.
*   **Pulvinar**: This structure projects to the cortex and is distinct from other areas.

#### F. Conclusion

The visual system's expansion into the end brain is a complex process that involves the development of several key structures. Understanding these pathways can provide insights into how we learn, remember, and perceive our environment.
