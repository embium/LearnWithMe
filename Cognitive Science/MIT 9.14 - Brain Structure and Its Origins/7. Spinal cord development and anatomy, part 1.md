### I. Neural Tube Formation
#### A. Introduction to Neural Tube Development

The formation of the nervous system begins with the development of a neural tube, which is induced by molecules from the notochord. This process involves complex cellular events and molecular signals that ultimately lead to the formation of distinct regions within the neural tube.

#### B. Cellular Events in Neural Tube Formation

- **Neural Plate Formation**: The first step in neural tube formation is the creation of a neural plate, which is induced by molecules from the notochord.
- **Invagination and Groove Formation**: As the neural plate invaginates, it forms a groove along the back of the organism. This process involves cellular events such as contraction, adhesion, movement, and growth.

#### C. Neural Crest Cells and Peripheral Nervous System Development

The neural crest cells remain on the outside of the neural tube and are responsible for forming the peripheral nervous system. These cells undergo a series of complex migrations and interactions to eventually form various components of the PNS.

### II. Regionalization of the Neural Tube
#### A. Introduction to Regionalization

As the neural tube closes, it forms distinct regions: the roof plate and floor plate at the top and bottom, respectively. The ventral part closest to the notochord proliferates faster to form motor neurons.

#### B. Closure of the Neural Tube

- **Cervical Region**: The first region to close is the cervical region of the spinal cord.
- **Rostral and Caudal Parts**: The rostral and caudal parts of the neural tube also undergo closure, with the last regions to close being the most advanced parts of the CNS.

#### C. Abnormalities in Neural Tube Closure

Abnormalities in this process can lead to conditions such as spina bifida or anencephaly. These conditions highlight the importance of precise cellular events and molecular signals in neural tube formation.

### III. Molecular Signals and Factors
#### A. Sonic Hedgehog's Role in Neural Tube Formation

The neural tube's closure is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of various cellular events and molecular signals, including **Sonic Hedgehog**. This ventralizing influence induces changes in the ventral part of the neural tube, leading to the early differentiation of motor neurons.

#### B. Dorsalizing Factors and Neural Tube Development

In contrast, dorsalizing factors secreted by the ectoderm induce changes in the dorsal part of the cord, causing cells to develop differently than those in the ventral region.

### IV. Cell Division and Migration
#### A. Introduction to Cell Division and Migration

The development of the nervous system involves cell division, with two main types: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric cell division results in stem cells that continue to divide, while asymmetric division leads to one daughter cell remaining a stem cell and the other becoming postmitotic and migrating away from the ventricle.

#### B. Asymmetric Cell Division and Nuclear Translocation

- **Nuclear Translocation**: This type of migration was initially thought to be unique to the spinal cord but has since been found to occur in the brain as well.
- **Multiple Types of Cell Movement**: The discovery of this mode of migration helped resolve a long-standing debate between two theories of cell movement, and it is now recognized that there are multiple types of cell movement involved in nervous system development.
