### I. Patterning in Movement: Mechanisms and Implications
#### A. Endogenous CNS Activity and Plasticity

The concept of patterning in movement has been explored through various mechanisms, including endogenous CNS activity and plasticity. While little is known about plasticity's role in timing, it would be critical if it were a mechanism for timing, given the problem of timing in neuroscience.

Plasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This process can lead to changes in the way information is processed and stored in the brain. In the context of movement patterning, plasticity could play a crucial role in adapting to changing environments or learning new motor skills.

However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between plasticity and timing in movement patterning. The complexity of the human brain and its many interconnected systems make it challenging to study and model this phenomenon accurately.

#### B. Neuromodulators and Brain State Control

Neuromodulators can alter the state of the brain, affecting pattern production, as seen in studies on invertebrates. These chemicals can influence various aspects of brain function, including attention, arousal, and sleep-wake cycles.

The control of the overall state of the brain involves drastic changes, such as sleep, arousal, and attention, with various states possible, but their anatomy is not well understood. Two types of mechanisms could control a change in brain state: chemical secretions into the cerebrospinal fluid or widely projecting axonal systems.

Examples of these systems include:

*   Coleric, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, which play major roles in sleep-wake cycles and arousal states.
*   These systems have widespread projections, affecting various parts of the brain, including the neocortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus.

The number of possible brain states is estimated to be around 65,536, assuming four possible states for each system. This estimate is based on simplifying assumptions, as studies suggest that these systems may have many more possible states than assumed here.

### II. Evolution of Brain Structure and Function
#### A. Major Expansions in Brain Development

The evolution of brain structure is characterized by three major expansions, which significantly contributed to the development of complex behaviors and sensory capabilities.

1.  **First Expansion: Olfactory Bulb Growth**

    The first expansion involved the growth of the olfactory bulb, connecting to various parts of the forebrain in early animals. This allowed for more sophisticated processing of smells and odors.
2.  **Second Expansion: Sensory Invasion**

    Later, other senses invaded the forebrain, primarily through projections from structures like the midbrain tectum, which connected with the thalamus and cortex. This invasion took advantage of existing learning pathways in the striatum, allowing for more complex behaviors.

3.  **Third Expansion: Neocortex Emergence**

    The third expansion saw the evolution of the neocortex, emerging from the dorsal cortex in reptiles and eventually leading to significant advantages in function and expansion. These expansions did not directly lead to the large size of the human brain but were followed by later developments, such as the expansion of association areas that enabled language and other complex functions.

#### B. Brain Structure and Sensory Capabilities

In animals with large neocortices, other structures like the cerebellum, thalamus, and pons also tend to be larger, projecting to and receiving input from the neocortex. This suggests a strong relationship between brain size and sensory capabilities.

### III. Sensory Pathways and Motor Control
#### A. Dermatome Maps and Trigeminal Nerve

The face is not part of the dermatome maps due to its innervation by the trigeminal nerve, which has a descending nucleus in the brainstem that represents facial sensations. This unique arrangement allows for specialized processing of sensory information from the face.

#### B. Ascending Sensory Pathways

The oldest ascending sensory pathway is the spinothalamic tract, which conveys pain and temperature information. This pathway plays a critical role in detecting and responding to painful stimuli.

### IV. Motor Control and Developmental Processes
#### A. Basic Cellular Events and Membrane Addition

Understanding basic cellular events like adhesion, contraction, growth, and movement is crucial for developmental processes, as well as knowing about membrane addition, symmetric and asymmetric cell division, and the sympathetic nervous system.

The preganglionic motor neurons of the sympathetic nervous system are called "motor" because they leave the spinal cord, while their ganglionic counterparts come from sympathetic ganglia along the spine. This distinction highlights the complex interplay between different components of the nervous system.

#### B. Motor Cortex Representation and Manual Dexterity

The raccoon's manual dexterity is reflected in the large representation of digits in its motor cortex, with separate gyri for each digit. This specialized arrangement allows for precise control over individual fingers, enabling the raccoon to manipulate objects with ease.

This document provides an overview of various mechanisms related to patterning in movement, including endogenous CNS activity and plasticity, neuromodulators, brain state control, evolution of brain structure and function, sensory pathways, motor control, and basic cellular events.
