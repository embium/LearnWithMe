### I. Improving Class Format and Engagement
#### A. Introduction to New Class Structure

The instructor has expressed dissatisfaction with the previous class format, citing that students spent too much time reviewing for a quiz on a chapter not covered in class. To address this issue, the instructor plans to implement a new structure where a short quiz is given every class, consisting of one or two questions. One question will be from the new chapter, and the other will be from the previous class. This change aims to ensure students read the assigned material before class.

#### B. Incorporating Active Learning Exercises

In addition to the short quizzes, the instructor proposes incorporating more active learning exercises into the class. These exercises may include labeling pictures or completing worksheets that engage students in their learning process. The practice quizzes conducted during this lecture demonstrate these changes, with students working on questions related to the midbrain and diencephalon.

#### C. Emphasis on Understanding Key Concepts

The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding key concepts, such as the functional divisions of the midbrain and diencephalon. Specifically, they highlight the central gray area and ventral tegmental area as crucial regions in these structures. The instructor also explains the concept of long tracts, which carry sensory information from the spinal cord to the thalamus and subthalamus.

#### D. Review of Embryonic Development

The instructor touches on the embryonic development of the forebrain, highlighting the ganglionic eminences as large collections of dividing cells that eventually give rise to various brain structures. This provides a foundation for understanding the complex relationships between different brain regions.

### II. Understanding Brain Structure and Function
#### A. Overview of the Forebrain

The instructor reviews the major features of the forebrain, including its subdivisions and pathways. This section serves as a refresher on the key components of the forebrain and their functions.

#### B. The Paramal Tract and Its Variations

The paramal tract is a bundle of axons that descends from the forebrain to the spinal cord. However, it decussates in the hindbrain and is referred to by different names at various levels. In primates, this tract is associated with the cortical spinal axis, while in rodents, it's called the ventral part of the dorsal column.

#### C. Internal Capsule Fibers

The internal capsule fibers are a two-way street, with many axons going up into the cortex and others descending into the spinal cord. Once past the diencephalon, most axons in this bundle descend all the way to the spinal cord.

#### D. Somatic and Limbic Systems

The instructor distinguishes between the somatic and limbic systems, highlighting their different connections and functions. The neocortex is involved in both systems but has longer connections than those of the limbic system. The striatum's limbic parts are strongly connected to the hypothalamus and other limbic structures.

#### E. Neuron Anatomy and System Connections

The instructor explains that the distinction between somatic and limbic systems is supported by neuron anatomy. The neocortex's outputs are characterized by longer axons that reach the spinal cord, whereas the corpus striatum's pathways don't make it past the midbrain.

### III. Key Concepts and Takeaways
#### A. Summary of Important Points

* Short quizzes will be given every class to ensure students read assigned material before class.
* Active learning exercises, such as labeling pictures or completing worksheets, will be incorporated into the class.
* Understanding key concepts, such as functional divisions of the midbrain and diencephalon, is crucial for grasping brain structure and function.
* The paramal tract decussates in the hindbrain and is referred to by different names at various levels.
* The internal capsule fibers are a two-way street with axons going up into the cortex or descending into the spinal cord.
* The somatic and limbic systems have distinct connections and functions, supported by neuron anatomy.

#### B. Review of Important Concepts

The instructor pauses to review important concepts covered in the class so far, ensuring students understand the key points discussed during the lecture.
