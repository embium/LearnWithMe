### I. Introduction to Consciousness and Clinical Applications
#### A. Overview of the Lecture Topic

Today's lecture marks a significant milestone as students have officially passed the mid-term mark. The discussion will focus on the practical application of consciousness, exploring its current research studies and theoretical approaches in a clinical setting. This week's topic is often referred to as "medicine on off and off the brain," which encompasses the intersection of mind, body, and spirit.

#### B. Career Paths and Healthcare Disciplines

Students are encouraged to view this lecture as a way to better prepare for potential career paths in therapy, counseling, coaching, psychology, psychotherapy, psychiatry, or other branches of healthcare. The discussion will examine the concept of treating, healing, and curing, with an emphasis on the distinction between these terms.

### II. Treating, Healing, and Curing
#### A. Defining Key Concepts

Treating refers to providing support, while healing involves integration and continuation of self. Curing implies fixing a problem, but in reality, it's about creating conditions for the body to reintegrate itself. The discussion will also touch on the importance of understanding the parameters of the healing process, including the role of neurotransmitters, chemicals, and hormones.

#### B. Biomedical Model vs. Psychological Process

The biomedical model will be compared to the psychological process, highlighting the intersection between mind and body. This comparison aims to foster an understanding of the complexities involved in treating, healing, and curing.

### III. Sensus Divinitatis and Healing
#### A. Conceptualizing the Sense of the Divine

The concept of sensus divinitatis, or the sense of the Divine, will be explored, with a focus on its connection to healing and the development of a sense of self. Students will examine the idea that healing can happen when one is closer to developing this sense of the Divine.

#### B. Franco Basaglia's Approach

The work of Franco Basaglia, a renowned brain scientist and psychiatrist, will be highlighted as an example of how to approach this topic. His attitude towards what it means to be healthy, cured, or treated will be emphasized.

### IV. Philosophical Concepts and Mind-Body-Spirit Connection
#### A. Dualism and Monism

Throughout the discussion, students will engage with philosophical concepts, including dualism and monism, and explore the connection between mind, body, and spirit. The lecture aims to foster an understanding of these complexities and encourage students to develop a nuanced perspective on these topics.

### V. Sacred Diseases and Epilepsy
#### A. Historical Context

The concept of sacred diseases has been associated with epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This condition is characterized by unprovoked focal seizures located in the temporal lobe of the brain. TLE accounts for approximately 60% of all adult epilepsy cases.

#### B. Research and Stigma Reduction

Research suggests that epilepsy can have a profound impact on an individual's personality, behavior, and cognitive functions. Despite the stigma surrounding epilepsy, recent studies emphasize the importance of understanding the neurological underpinnings of this disorder and promoting a more tolerant and empathetic perception of individuals affected by it.

### VI. Neuroanatomy and Species Connection
#### A. Bridging the Gap between Humans and Non-Human Animals

The study of neuroanatomy has led researchers to believe that certain anatomical features are indicative of cerebral organization moving towards a more human-like pattern, bridging the gap between humans and non-human animals.

#### B. Hemispherical Specialization and Clinical Neurophysiology

The study of geometry, symmetry, and unevenness between brain hemispheres can indicate hemispherical specialization, accounting for specific differences in emotions, behavior, and processing speed. Clinical neurophysiology is a field connected to medicine, studying neural function, including the physiology of neural function.

### VII. Psychoneuroimmunology and Psychopharmacology
#### A. Emotions and Health

The study of psychoneuroimmunology further develops the analysis on the connection between mind and body, moving attention to ecological and diagnostic aspects of mental disorders and syndromes. This field provides clear scientific evidence for the importance of emotions in health and well-being.

#### B. Medications and Mental Health Disorders

The study of psychopharmacology is essential in understanding the role of medications in treating mental health disorders, with a focus on empirical, laboratory-based evidence, and theoretical philosophical and social aspects.
