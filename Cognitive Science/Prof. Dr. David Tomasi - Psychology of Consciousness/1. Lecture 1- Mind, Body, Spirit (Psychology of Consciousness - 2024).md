### I. Course Overview
#### A. Introduction to the Psychology of Consciousness

The Psychology of Consciousness is a 15-week online course that delves into the neural underpinnings of cognition, emotion, and action. This comprehensive exploration aims to present a scientist-based and student-friendly examination of consciousness, its historical, philosophical, anthropological, and social context, as well as its current scientific research and literature.

#### B. Course Objectives

- To understand the neural basis of consciousness through lectures, discussions, quizzes, and assignments.
- To explore topics such as neuroanatomy, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history to comprehend what makes us human.
- To examine the mind-body problem, the role of spirituality and religion, and the possibility of existence beyond the physical realm.
- To foster growth, insight, and self-awareness through discussions and assignments that encourage students to explore topics from a transcendental perspective.

#### C. Course Structure

The course is designed to be student-friendly and scientist-based, with a focus on real-world applications. It includes:

- Lectures: In-depth explorations of key concepts in consciousness studies.
- Discussions: Opportunities for students to share their experiences, interests, and curiosities related to the topics covered.
- Quizzes and Assignments: Assessments that test understanding and application of course material.
- Final Exam: A comprehensive synthesis of knowledge that requires students to apply what they have learned to real-world scenarios.

### II. The Concept of Symbol vs. Diablo
#### A. Introduction to the Dichotomy

The concept of symbol versus diable represents a fundamental contradiction in our understanding of reality. These two terms are often seen as opposites, but this dichotomy is not absolute. A symbolic perspective sees reality as a holistic unity, considering patterns and complexity without reducing them to black-and-white terms.

#### B. The Origins of Diablo

The term "diablo" originates from the Greek concept of devil, which has been misinterpreted as being related to evil. However, this etymology is incorrect, and the true meaning of devil relates to the absence of light or higher knowledge. The Luciferian perspective views the devil as a fallen angel who seeks to usurp God's power.

#### C. Symbolic Understanding

A symbolic understanding sees reality as a unified whole, where opposites are not mutually exclusive but rather exist on a spectrum. This approach is essential in modern times, where humanism and transhumanism have led to a focus on logic and physical matter over spiritual transcendence.

### III. Consciousness and the Brain
#### A. The Prefrontal Cortex

Consciousness is related to the prefrontal cortex, which is the last part of the brain to develop neurobiologically. This region is responsible for logical reasoning and scientific empirical knowledge, making it a crucial aspect of our understanding of reality.

#### B. Embodied Cognition

The embodied cognition approach attempts to bridge the gap between mind and matter by studying knowledge from the perspective of being inside one's body. This approach recognizes that we experience the world through our senses and bodily experiences, which have a neural underpinning.

### IV. Holistic Understanding
#### A. Moving Beyond Dualism

The concept of symbol versus diable highlights the need for a holistic understanding of reality, where opposites are not mutually exclusive but rather exist on a spectrum. By embracing this perspective, we can move beyond dualistic thinking and towards a more unified and comprehensive view of consciousness and reality.

#### B. The Complexity of Reality

This course challenges the idea that everyone has their own reality, suggesting instead that there is no universal or absolute truth. The extremes of nature versus nurture are also debunked, as both positions oversimplify complex issues. In reality, the relationship between brain function and behavior is more nuanced, with neither factor dominating the other.

#### C. Compassionate Approach

This understanding allows for a more compassionate approach to addressing issues like low self-esteem, as it acknowledges that both neurological patterns and life experiences contribute to one's state of mind.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. The Psychology of Consciousness

The psychology of consciousness is a holistic field that seeks to bridge the gap between brain and mind, exploring questions related to spirituality, sense of self, hope, and ultimately, love. This course provides a comprehensive exploration of these topics, aiming to foster growth, insight, and self-awareness in its students.
