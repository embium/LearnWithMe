### I. Understanding the Mind: A Computational Perspective
#### A. Introduction to Cognitive Science and the Framework of Computation

The study of cognitive science seeks to understand how the brain gives rise to the mind, a question central to this field. To address this inquiry, researchers have developed a framework for thinking about minds as sets of computations that extract representations. This idea implies that if we truly understood minds, we could write code to replicate their functions. However, developing such a precise computational theory is challenging, and the first step involves understanding what is computed and why.

This concept can be illustrated through various examples, including color vision. Color is used for multiple purposes, such as identifying objects, determining properties like ripeness or edibility, and even driving by recognizing traffic lights. However, when trying to determine an object's reflectance (its surface property) from the light hitting it, we encounter an ill-posed problem â€“ there isn't enough information to uniquely solve it.

This issue is not unique to color vision; other perception-related problems, like shape perception and learning word meanings, also involve ill-posed problems. In these cases, additional assumptions or knowledge must be brought in from outside sources to make informed decisions.

#### B. The Levels of Analysis: Algorithm, Representation, and Hardware Implementation

The course explores the different levels at which one can analyze cognitive processes, including:

*   **Algorithm and representation**: This level involves understanding how a system solves its problem, whether we can write code for it, and what computations and representations are involved.
*   **Hardware implementation in brains**: This level involves neurons and brain regions. While not covered in detail here, there is significant research on the brain basis of color vision, including studies on specific brain areas involved in color processing.

Understanding face perception requires multiple levels of analysis, and thus various methods to comprehend it. To approach this complex problem, we need to consider different questions and levels of analysis, such as the neural basis of color vision and brain function.

#### C. The Case of Face Perception: A Multilevel Analysis

Face recognition is a distinct cognitive process that can be impaired independently of other cognitive functions. Research has shown that about two percent of the population experiences difficulties in recognizing faces, which is uncorrelated with IQ or other perceptual abilities. This suggests that face recognition is a unique cognitive process.

Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of deep neural networks that are highly effective in face recognition tasks, raising questions about the nature of human face perception and whether these models can provide insights into how humans process faces.

#### D. Functional MRI and Brain Imaging

The functional MRI signal used in brain imaging is called the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent) signal, which measures blood flow and oxygenation levels. When neurons fire, they require more energy, leading to increased blood flow to that area of the brain. This increase in blood flow results in a higher concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, which produces a magnetic difference detectable by MRI.

The BOLD signal is indirect, meaning it doesn't directly measure neural activity but rather its consequences on blood flow and oxygenation. Despite this, functional MRI has been able to produce surprisingly linear signals with neural activity, allowing researchers to discover various aspects of brain organization.

However, the technique has limitations, including low spatial resolution (around 1-2 mm) and poor temporal resolution (blood flow changes take several seconds). The BOLD signal also doesn't directly translate into absolute amounts of neural activity, making it difficult to determine exact levels of metabolic activity.
