### I. The Universal Nature of Number Sense
#### A. Introduction to Number Sense

Number sense is a fundamental concept that humans use every day without realizing it. It involves comparing quantities, telling time, choosing the larger of two objects, or deciding which line is shorter at a grocery store. These comparisons are not unique to humans and can be mastered by animals as well. Research suggests that animals possess an innate ability to understand numbers, which is supported by studies showing that they can form teams based on numerical advantage, optimize food foraging behavior, and engage in complex strategic situations.

#### B. Animal Number Sense

Studies have shown that animals such as macaws and honeybees possess a biologically determined domain-specific representation of number. This means that they can represent large numerical magnitudes without verbal counting. Their ability is approximate and depends on the ratio of numbers rather than their absolute difference. For example, research has demonstrated that honeybees can perform arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, and even understand the concept of zero, despite having only 100 million neurons in their brains.

#### C. Shared Number Sense with Humans

The ability to understand numbers and quantities is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, present from birth in infants. Research has shown that newborns can distinguish between small and large numbers, and this ability is also found in animals such as macaws and honeybees. This suggests that numerical abilities are part of our basic cognitive machinery, shared with other animals.

#### D. Brain Regions Involved in Number Sense

The brain region responsible for number sense is thought to be located in the parietal lobe, particularly around the intraparietal sulcus. However, recent studies have challenged this view, suggesting that there may not be a specific brain region dedicated solely to numerical processing, but rather a common region for processing magnitude of various dimensions.

### II. The Development and Individual Differences in Number Sense
#### A. Early Number Sense

Research has shown that the speed of dot estimation task at kindergarten age is predictive of later arithmetic ability, suggesting that early number sense can be a strong indicator of future math skills. This variation is similar to other cognitive abilities like navigation and face recognition.

#### B. Individual Differences in Number Sense

Studies have found that individual differences in people's ability to perceive numbers are significant, with some being significantly better or worse at it than others. This variation is independent of IQ and can be a strong predictor of later arithmetic abilities.

### III. The Approximate Number System
#### A. Introduction to the Approximate Number System

The approximate number system allows humans to perform mental arithmetic with rough estimates rather than exact calculations. This basic system follows Weber's law, where the ability to discriminate between two numbers increases as their ratio, not difference, grows.

#### B. Shared Approximate Number System with Animals and Newborns

Research has shown that this system is shared with animals and newborns, applying to various objects, modalities, and spatial or temporal contexts. The left intraparietal sulcus is a key locus for the approximate number system, including number-specific neurons.

#### C. Overlapping Representations in the Parietal Lobe

Studies have found similar representations in the parietal lobe, which may not be as specialized as other systems like faces and motion. Furthermore, research has shown that number representations overlap with spatial representations, as demonstrated by cross-decoding between eye movement direction and arithmetic operations.

### IV. Conclusion
The study of number sense has revealed a fundamental aspect of human cognition that is shared with animals. Research has shown that the ability to understand numbers and quantities is present from birth in infants and is a strong indicator of future math skills. The brain regions involved in number sense are complex, and recent studies have challenged the traditional view of a specific region dedicated solely to numerical processing.
