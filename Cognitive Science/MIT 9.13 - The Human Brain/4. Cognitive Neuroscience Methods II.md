### I. Introduction to Human Cognitive Neuroscience
#### A. Understanding Face Perception: Methods and Findings

Human cognitive neuroscience is a field that seeks to understand how the brain processes information, with a primary goal of gaining insights into complex mental phenomena such as face perception. Researchers have employed various methods, including behavioral studies and functional MRI (fMRI), to investigate this process.

Behavioral data has shown that people's ability to recognize faces is influenced by their familiarity with the individual, with more accurate recognition occurring for familiar faces than unfamiliar ones. This suggests that our mental representation of faces is not entirely invariant, but rather dependent on the specific image. Furthermore, research has demonstrated a "face inversion effect," where people perform poorly at recognizing upside-down faces compared to upright ones, indicating that face perception may be processed differently in the brain than other visual stimuli.

#### B. The Role of Functional MRI (fMRI) Studies

Functional MRI studies have revealed a distinct region of the brain, known as the fusiform face area (FFA), which responds selectively to faces and is found in a similar location across most subjects. However, while these findings are significant, they do not necessarily reveal how face recognition works in the human brain, but rather provide a foundation for further investigation.

The advantages of fMRI include its high spatial resolution, allowing researchers to pinpoint specific brain regions involved in processing information. Nevertheless, this method has limitations, such as its indirect and imprecise nature, inability to determine causal involvement in perception or cognition, and high cost.

#### C. Limitations of fMRI: The Need for Alternative Methods

While functional MRI can provide insights into brain activity, it's not suitable for measuring reaction times or fast processes like face recognition. One method to study this is electroencephalography (EEG), which involves placing electrodes on the scalp to measure electrical potentials. However, EEG has poor spatial resolution and can only detect broad patterns of neural activity.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers better temporal resolution than EEG but still struggles with spatial resolution. MEG detects magnetic fields generated by neural activity, allowing researchers to infer the location of sources within the brain.

#### D. Direct Neural Recordings: High Spatial and Temporal Resolution

In rare cases, neurosurgical patients have electrodes implanted directly on their brains for clinical purposes, providing high-resolution data from individual neurons. Such recordings have revealed phase-specific responses in the fusiform face area (FFA), a region critical for face recognition.

These findings suggest that face detection occurs rapidly, with responses starting around 130 milliseconds and peaking at 170 milliseconds after stimulus presentation. However, even with direct neural recordings, it's challenging to pinpoint specific neurons involved in face recognition due to the limited number of electrodes and their placement variability across individuals.

#### E. Intracranial Recording: A Powerful Tool for Understanding Neural Function

The method of intracranial recording offers high spatial and temporal resolution but is limited by its invasive nature and inability to establish causality. This method can only be used in controlled clinical situations where a patient has undergone neurosurgery, and even then, the placement of electrodes is determined by clinicians rather than researchers.

Despite these limitations, intracranial recording remains one of the most powerful tools for understanding neural function in humans. However, its inability to establish causality means that it cannot be used to determine the causal role of a particular neural phenomenon in cognition and behavior.

#### F. Alternative Methods: Studying Patients with Brain Damage or Developmental Disorders

To overcome the limitations of intracranial recording, researchers have turned to alternative methods, such as studying patients with brain damage or developmental disorders, which can provide more direct evidence for the causal role of specific brain regions.

For example, a patient with prosopagnosia, who is unable to recognize faces due to damage to a specific region of the brain, provides strong evidence that this region is specialized for face recognition. Similarly, a patient with a rare syndrome known as CK, who is severely impaired at object recognition but normal at face recognition, provides even more powerful evidence that face recognition involves a distinct neural pathway.

The use of electrical stimulation in these patients can further establish the causal role of specific brain regions and provide strong evidence for the specialization of certain brain areas for particular cognitive functions.
