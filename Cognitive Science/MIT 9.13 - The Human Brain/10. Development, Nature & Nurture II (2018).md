### I. Face Perception and Innateness
#### A. Introduction to Face Perception and Innateness

The question of what is innate about face perception and how brains wire up to process faces remains largely unanswered. While some studies suggest that newborns have an innate bias towards looking at faces, others propose that this could be due to simple properties of stimuli rather than a specific template for faces. Recent data on monkeys reared without seeing faces show that the development of face patches in their brains is also not entirely clear-cut.

#### B. The Role of Innate Selectivity and Long-Range Connectivity

One possibility is that what's innate is some other kind of simpler selectivity, such as selectivity for curved things, which could lead to face selectivity later on. Another idea is that long-range structural connectivity between brain regions plays a crucial role in determining the location and function of face areas. This suggests that while there may not be an innate template for faces, the underlying neural architecture may still play a significant role in shaping face perception.

#### C. Deep Net Modeling and Face Perception

Deep net modeling has become a powerful tool for investigating these questions from a different angle. By asking what conditions are necessary for a network to produce face patches, researchers can gain insights into why our minds and brains are organized that way. Recent studies using diffusion tractography have shown that long-range connectivity fingerprints can predict the location of functional regions in adults, including face-selective areas.

### II. The Role of Experience in Shaping Cortical Function
#### A. Rewired Ferrets and the Causal Role of Connectivity

A study on rewired ferrets has provided a crucial test case for understanding the causal role of connectivity and experience in shaping cortical function. By surgically re-routing connections at birth, researchers found that primary auditory cortex in ferrets can become visual cortex-like, with orientation columns and responding to visual input. The ferret's brain learns to interpret this new input as visual information, rather than auditory.

#### B. Implications for Understanding Cortical Function

This study has implications for understanding how our brains are wired up during development, and whether experience or connectivity plays a more significant role in determining cortical function. A similar test case is the case of reading, which is a recent cultural invention that cannot be innate due to its short history.

#### C. The Visual Word Form Area

Recent studies have indeed found such a patch in the bottom of the left hemisphere near face-selective regions, which responds more strongly to words than pictures. The alternative accounts for this activation include the possibility that it's due to general linguistic processing or even attentional mechanisms rather than specific visual word recognition.

### III. Innateness and Experience in Spatial Representation
#### A. Introduction to Spatial Representation

The brain's basic structure is largely innate, with most neurons and long-range connections present at birth. However, some selective cortical regions appear to depend on experience for their development, such as the face-deprived monkeys' lack of face patches and the ferrets' rewired auditory cortex responding to visual input.

#### B. Innate Spatial Representations

Studies have shown that head direction cells, place cells, and grid cells are present early on in development, even before the animals have had significant experience navigating their environment. This suggests that these spatial representations may be largely innate, as they are present at birth and do not require experience to develop.

#### C. The Ability to Use Shape of Space for Reorientation

The ability to use the shape of space for reorientation is also thought to be innate, with studies using controlled rearing in chickens showing that this ability is present even without geometric information. This is in contrast to the face system and visually word form area, where there is strong evidence for experiential basis and no strong evidence for innateness, respectively.

### IV. Brain Damage and Cortical Function
#### A. The Importance of Precursors

Research on brain damage suggests that certain aspects of cognition are necessary precursors for others, and if damaged early in life, may have bigger long-term consequences. For example, primary auditory cortex damage at birth can make it harder to learn language later on.

#### B. Congenital Blindness and Cortical Reorganization

However, congenital blindness presents a different case. In blind individuals, visual cortex is reorganized and takes on new functions, such as processing language. This suggests that with different experience, the organization of certain brain regions can be very different.

#### C. The Development of Visually Category Selective Regions

A recent study found that the development of visually category selective regions in the ventral visual cortex does not require visual experience, but rather auditory experience can elicit similar selectivity. This finding is contradictory to another study on face-deprived monkeys, which suggests that seeing faces is necessary for face domain formation.

### V. Conclusion
The question of what is innate about face perception and how brains wire up to process faces remains largely unanswered. While some studies suggest that newborns have an innate bias towards looking at faces, others propose that this could be due to simple properties of stimuli rather than a specific template for faces. Recent data on monkeys reared without seeing faces show that the development of face patches in their brains is also not entirely clear-cut.
