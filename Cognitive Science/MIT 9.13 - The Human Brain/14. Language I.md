### I. The Nature of Language
#### A. Overview of Human Language Abilities

Language is a uniquely human ability, present in all neurologically intact humans worldwide. Approximately 7,000 languages exist globally, showcasing the diversity and complexity of human communication. Unlike animals, such as chimps and parrots, which can accomplish impressive tasks like learning hundreds of nouns, human language is open-ended and compositional, allowing us to combine words to say new things that no one has ever said before.

#### B. Key Components of Language

To understand a language cognitively, we need to grasp four essential components:

*   **Phonology**: The sounds of language, which form the building blocks of spoken and written communication.
*   **Semantics**: What words mean, encompassing the meaning and reference of linguistic expressions.
*   **Syntax**: The structure or grammar of a language, governing how words are combined to convey meaning.
*   **Pragmatics**: How we understand what someone means when they say something, taking into account context, intention, and social norms.

#### C. Debate on the Relationship Between Thought and Language

The core components of language are syntax and semantics, which will be explored further in subsequent lectures. A key question is whether language is distinct from the rest of thought, with some arguing that thinking without language is possible, especially in infants who can think about complex topics before learning language.

*   **Separate Entities**: Some researchers suggest that thought and language are separate entities, citing evidence from brain disorders like global aphasia, where individuals have impaired language abilities yet still possess intact thought processes.
*   **Intertwined Processes**: Others propose that thought and language are intertwined, with language playing a crucial role in development, as seen in deaf children who learn language later in life and exhibit impaired understanding of others' thoughts.

#### D. Research on the Approximate Number System

Studies have shown that the approximate number system is present in animals and humans without language, indicating that thought can exist independently of language. However, this does not necessarily imply that language is not essential for complex cognitive processes.

### II. The Brain's Language Centers
#### A. Overview of Brain Imaging Literature

The brain imaging literature has traditionally suggested that language overlaps with other cognitive processes, but this contradicts patient data suggesting a separation between thought and language. A methodological flaw in prior research may be responsible for this discrepancy.

#### B. Limitations of Group Analysis

Group analysis with functional MRI is a useful tool for identifying common brain regions engaged in different tasks. However, it has limitations, as individual differences in brain anatomy can result in variable coexistence of functions within a region.

*   **Anatomical Alignment**: When brains are aligned anatomically and analyzed as a group, consistent activation patterns can be observed across subjects.
*   **Functional Alignment**: To overcome the limitation of group analysis, it's essential to align brains functionally rather than anatomically, identifying specific regions in each subject individually using localizer tasks.

#### C. Localizing Language Regions

By aligning brains functionally and using localizer tasks, researchers can measure the response of language regions in various other tasks and find that they don't respond to non-linguistic thinking, supporting the idea that language is distinct from the rest of thought.

*   **Individual Brains**: This approach has been used to study individual brains and localize language regions, providing a more accurate understanding of brain function.
*   **Challenging Previous Findings**: This method challenges previous findings that suggested massive overlap between language and other cognitive processes.
