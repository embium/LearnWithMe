### I. Navigation: A Fundamental Problem for Organisms
#### A. Understanding the Two Key Questions of Navigation

Navigation is a fundamental problem that organisms need to solve, involving two key questions: where am I and how do I get from here to there. To answer the first question, we can recognize specific places, determine what kind of environment we're in (urban, natural, etc.), and have an awareness of our position relative to the spatial layout of our immediate surroundings. This situational awareness allows us to know where we are and how to get out if needed.

For example, even if you've never seen a particular place before, you can still extract some information about it, such as what kind of place it is and possible routes to take. This ability to recognize places and environments is crucial for navigation, as it allows us to build a mental map of our surroundings and make informed decisions about how to proceed.

#### B. The Role of Cognitive Maps in Navigation

When we can't see our target location directly, we need a broader mental map of the world to navigate. This idea was first articulated in a classic experiment where rats learned to find food by making a series of turns, but when placed in a new environment with multiple paths, they immediately came back out and went straight towards their goal, indicating that they had learned a general direction rather than specific routes.

This suggests that we have a cognitive map in our heads that allows us to abstract the general direction and navigate. Cognitive maps are mental representations of our surroundings, which help us to understand the layout of an environment and make decisions about how to move through it.

#### C. The Importance of Detailed Mental Maps for Navigation

To answer the second question of how to get from here to there, we need knowledge of physical barriers and what's an actual path and what isn't. We also need to know which parts are like paths and which parts are buildings, as well as other things to watch out for like cars and traffic.

This requires a more detailed mental map of the environment, including knowledge of paths, obstacles, and potential destinations. A detailed mental map allows us to plan routes, avoid hazards, and make informed decisions about how to navigate through an environment.

### II. Studying Navigation with Haxby's Method
#### A. Functional Localization of the Place Area (PPA)

In terms of how we can use Haxby's method to study navigation, we can functionally localize the place area (PPA) by scanning subjects while they look at scenes and objects, then collect patterns of response across voxels in the PPA.

We can split the data into even and odd runs, and compare the patterns of response when subjects are looking at different types of scenes or objects. This allows us to see if there's information in the PPA that enables us to discriminate between different categories, such as beach scenes from city scenes.

#### B. Predictions Using Haxby's Correlation Method

The key prediction using Haxby's correlation method is that if the PPA can discriminate between two categories (e.g., beach scenes and city scenes), we should see a stable pattern of response across voxels in the PPA when subjects are looking at each category.

This means that the patterns of response for even runs and odd runs within each category should be more similar than the patterns of response between different categories. By testing this prediction, researchers can gain insights into the neural basis of navigation and scene perception.

### III. The Neural Basis of Navigation
#### A. Key Brain Regions Involved in Navigation

The ability to navigate involves knowing one's current location, direction of movement, obstacles, and goal. To plan a route, it's essential to know which way you're headed, as this affects the instructions given to a robot or the path planned by humans.

The mental map of an environment also requires knowledge of spatial layout, not just where you are in it. Furthermore, even with a good system for these components, getting lost is still possible due to losing track, confusion, or other factors. A way to reorient oneself when lost is necessary, and this will be discussed further in the next lecture.

#### B. The Role of the Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA) in Navigation

Research has shown that the parahippocampal place area (PPA) responds more strongly to scenes than objects, and its response is not significantly different for familiar or unfamiliar scenes. This suggests that the PPA is processing something like the shape or geometry of space around you, visible in your immediate environment.

However, there are still questions about what exactly this means for navigation and how it relates to perception of scenes. The study of brain regions involved in navigation and scene perception has led to the identification of several key areas, including the posterior parietal association (PPA) cortex.

#### C. Other Brain Regions Involved in Navigation

The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) has also been implicated in navigation, with studies showing that it responds differently when viewing familiar versus unfamiliar scenes, suggesting its role in anchoring one's location and orientation within a mental map of the world.

Another region, the occipito-temporal (OT) area, has been shown to be involved in perceiving the structure of space around us, with TMS studies demonstrating that it is necessary for discriminating between different scenes. The hippocampus, which will be discussed further next time, also plays a role in navigation and scene perception.

### IV. Analyzing Neural Responses
#### A. Functional MRI Adaptation

When analyzing neural responses, researchers use a technique called functional MRI adaptation to determine if a region of the brain responds differently to similar stimuli. By presenting two identical images back-to-back and measuring the response, they find that it's lower than when different images are presented.

This suggests that the neurons in this region can discriminate between the images. To further test this, researchers use another method where they present two images with slight differences, such as viewpoint or facial expression, and measure the response.

#### B. Invariant Processing

If the response is similar to the one obtained when presenting identical images, it indicates that the neurons are invariant to these changes. This means that the region can recognize the underlying stimulus despite variations in presentation, allowing researchers to gain insights into what features of a stimulus are being processed by this brain region.

By using techniques like functional MRI adaptation and invariant processing, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how the brain processes navigation and scene perception, and how these processes relate to each other.
