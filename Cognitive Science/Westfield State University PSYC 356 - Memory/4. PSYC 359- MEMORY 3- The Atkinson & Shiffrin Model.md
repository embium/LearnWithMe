### I. Introduction to Memory Structure
#### A. Overview of the Atkinson and Schifrin Model

The Atkinson and Schifrin model of memory, also known as the modal model, has been a cornerstone in understanding human memory since its introduction in the 1960s. This model provides a comprehensive framework for how we remember things and the flow of information as we recall it. The model consists of three primary components: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.

#### B. Historical Context and Validation

The Atkinson and Schifrin model was validated using neuroimaging techniques, providing strong evidence for its accuracy in representing human memory processes. This validation has been crucial in refining our understanding of how we remember information and the relationships between different types of memory.

### II. Sensory Memory
#### A. Definition and Function

Sensory memory is a brief component of our central nervous system that temporarily holds sensory information from our environment. It serves as a gateway between what we sense and our conscious waking memory, allowing us to focus on specific parts of our body or visual field. The capacity of sensory memory is enormous, but its duration is extremely short, lasting less than 200 milliseconds.

#### B. Examples and Limitations

Sensory memory can be demonstrated through various studies where participants failed to notice changes in people walking by when their attention was disrupted. This highlights the importance of attention in transferring information from sensory memory into short-term memory. If attention is not given to sensory input, it generally gets lost and does not proceed further.

### III. Short-Term Memory
#### A. Definition and Capacity

Short-term memory, also known as working memory, has a limited capacity for complex stimuli. Estimates suggest that this capacity ranges from four to seven items plus or minus two, although research continues on the exact limit. It serves as an intermediary step between sensory memory and long-term memory, handling incoming experiences and recalling previously stored information.

#### B. Examples and Sub-Components

The ospan task is a classic example of short-term memory in action, requiring participants to remember words while performing math problems. Working memory can be broken down into three sub-components: a phonological loop for audio information, a visual spatial sketch pad for visual information, and an executive system for attention.

### IV. Long-Term Memory
#### A. Definition and Characteristics

Long-term memory is the longest lasting form of memory, with some arguing it's potentially limitless. While we may lose the ability to retrieve memories from long-term storage, the actual memories themselves are not lost. Examples include recognizing faces, riding a bike, playing an instrument, and speaking a language.

#### B. Types of Long-Term Memory

Long-term memory can be further divided into declarative memory (factual knowledge), episodic memory (personal experiences), and non-declarative implicit memory (skills and habits). Understanding these different types of long-term memory is crucial for grasping how memories are stored and retrieved.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Memory Structure

In conclusion, the Atkinson and Schifrin model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding human memory structure. It consists of sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory, each with its unique characteristics and functions. Understanding these components is essential for grasping how we remember information and the flow of that information as we recall it.

#### B. Future Directions

As we continue to explore these concepts, we'll delve into how memories are created cell by cell through neuroplasticity, learning, and conditioning. We'll also discuss the reliability of long-term memory, false memories, and the impact of traumatic brain injury or Alzheimer's on memory.
