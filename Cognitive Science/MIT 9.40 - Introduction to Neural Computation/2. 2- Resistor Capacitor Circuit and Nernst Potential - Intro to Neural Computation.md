### I. Introduction to the RC Model of a Neuron
#### A. Historical Background and Development of the Model

The RC model, or resistor-capacitor model, of a neuron was developed by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This model aimed to understand how neurons generate action potentials. By studying the squid giant axon, which is about a millimeter across, they were able to conduct experiments that led to the development of this equivalent circuit model.

#### B. Key Components of the RC Model

The RC model consists of two main components:

*   **Capacitor:** Represents the insulating shell of the neuron.
*   **Resistor:** Represents ion channels, which allow current to flow through the membrane.

### II. Derivation of Differential Equations for the RC Model
#### A. Capacitive Current and Voltage Relationship

When current is injected into the neuron, it creates a charge imbalance, resulting in an electric field and stored energy. The capacitive current is proportional to the time rate of change of the membrane potential. This relationship can be described by the differential equation:

dQ/dt = C \* dV/dt

where Q is the charge on the capacitor, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage across the capacitor.

#### B. Integration and Solution for Membrane Potential

By integrating this equation, we can find the solution for the membrane potential. This involves analyzing different current profiles, such as a linear ramp or a pulse, to see how the voltage responds.

### III. Adding Resistors to the RC Model
#### A. Leak Conductance and Resistor Representation

Next, we'll add resistors to our model to represent ion channels. The simplest kind of ion channel is the leak conductance, which can be represented by a resistor in our model. The leak current is proportional to the membrane potential divided by resistance.

#### B. Derivation of Equation for Leak Current and Voltage Relationship

By simplifying this equation, we'll get a steady-state solution for the voltage difference, which is just the injected current divided by resistance. This represents how big the hole in our cell is after we've poked it with a needle.

### IV. Steady-State Solution and Time Constant
#### A. V∞ and Its Relationship to Resistance and Injected Current

The membrane potential in steady state reaches a value known as V∞, which is determined by the resistance (R) times the injected current (Ie). This equation, VM + τdV/dt = V∞, is a first-order linear differential equation that will be seen repeatedly throughout the class.

#### B. Time Constant and Its Relationship to Resistance and Capacitance

The time constant τ, which is equal to R times C (where C is capacitance), determines how quickly this relaxation occurs. If tau is small, the derivative dV/dt will be large, indicating a rapid approach towards V∞. Conversely, if tau is large, the derivative dV/dt will be small, indicating a slow approach towards V∞.

### V. General Solution and Exponential Relaxation
#### A. V(t) = V∞ + (V0 - V∞)e^(-t/τ)

The general solution for the case where current is injected into the neuron can be written as V(t) = V∞ + (V0 - V∞)e^(-t/τ), where V0 is the initial voltage difference from V∞. This equation shows that the voltage difference between V and V∞ decays exponentially over time, with a time constant of τ.

### VI. Nernst Equation and Equilibrium Potential
#### A. Derivation Using the Boltzmann Equation

The Nernst equation, which describes the equilibrium potential for ions, can be derived using the Boltzmann equation. This equation relates the probability of an ion being in one state versus another to the energy difference between those states.

#### B. Calculation of Equilibrium Potential for Potassium Ions

By applying this concept to potassium ions, we find that the voltage difference (ΔV) across a cell membrane is proportional to the log of the ratio of potassium concentration outside to inside. Specifically, ΔV = -25 mV × log(concentration outside / concentration inside). Using real-world values for squid giant axon cells (400 mM inside and 20 mM outside), we calculate the equilibrium potential for potassium ions to be approximately -75 mV.

#### C. Significance of Negative Sign in Nernst Equation

The negative sign indicates that positive ions (such as potassium) moving out of the cell result in a decrease in voltage inside the cell.
