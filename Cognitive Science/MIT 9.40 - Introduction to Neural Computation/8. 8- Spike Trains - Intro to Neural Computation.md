### I. Introduction to Neural Recording
#### A. Overview of Neural Recording Techniques

Neural recording is a crucial aspect of understanding neural function and behavior. In this section, we will explore various techniques used to record neural activity, including intracellular and extracellular recordings.

Intracellular recordings involve placing electrodes directly inside neurons to measure membrane potentials. However, this method is challenging to apply in behaving animals due to the difficulty in accessing the neuron's interior. Extracellular recordings, on the other hand, involve placing electrodes near cells of interest to measure voltage changes in the brain. This type of recording is more feasible and provides valuable insights into neural activity.

#### B. Principles of Extracellular Recording

Extracellular recording involves measuring voltage changes associated with current flow through extracellular space. By connecting an electrode to a differential amplifier, we can measure the voltage difference between two terminals, providing a measurement of the voltage change relative to a reference point. The voltage changes measured are proportional to the derivative of the membrane potential.

To understand this concept better, let's consider a spherical neuron with sodium and potassium channels. The action potential generates an influx of sodium followed by an outflux of potassium, producing a large positive-going change in voltage inside the cell. However, there is no spatial separation of currents flowing through the membrane, resulting in no current flow in extracellular space and thus no extracellular voltage changes.

### II. Equivalent Circuit Model of Neural Activity
#### A. Introduction to Equivalent Circuit Models

An equivalent circuit model is a mathematical representation of neural activity that helps us understand how neurons process information. In this section, we will explore the concept of an equivalent circuit model and its application in understanding neural activity.

The somatic compartment is connected to the dendritic compartment with extracellular resistance. The voltage changes measured are proportional to the derivative of the membrane potential. This can be analyzed using an equivalent circuit model, where the somatic compartment is connected to the dendritic compartment with extracellular resistance.

#### B. Analysis of Voltage Changes

Inhibitory synapses produce outward-going currents, resulting in an increase in extracellular voltage near the synapse and a decrease near the soma. Excitatory synapses produce inward-going currents that flow into the dendrite and back to the soma through extracellular space. The region near the synapse appears as a current sink, while the region near the soma appears as a current source.

### III. Recording Neural Activity
#### A. Equipment Used for Recording

To record neural activity, we use an electrode placed near the soma connected to a differential amplifier, which measures the voltage difference between two terminals. The output is then amplified and digitized using an analog-to-digital converter, sampling the signal at regular intervals.

This results in a signal with slow modulation corresponding to theta rhythms and fast deflections representing action potentials. By analyzing the power spectrum of this signal, we can extract the low-frequency components and high-pass filter the signal to reveal only the high-frequency components, which correspond to action potentials.

#### B. Spike Detection and Analysis

We can then detect spikes by setting a threshold on the amplitude of the peaks in the waveform and writing down the time at which each spike occurs. This results in a list of spike times, which we can represent as a sum of delta functions or as the derivative of a spike count function.

The spike train has units of spikes per second, and analyzing this signal allows us to extract properties such as tuning curves, which measure the firing rate of neurons as a function of some parameter. For example, in primary visual cortex, neurons are tuned to orientation, while in auditory cortex, neurons are tuned to different frequencies.

### IV. Analysis of Spike Trains
#### A. Tuning Curves and Firing Rates

Motor cortical neurons exhibit tuning for particular movement directions, with some neurons responding more strongly to movements in certain directions. This can be quantified by counting spikes within a specific time interval and plotting them as a function of the angle of movement.

The firing rate varies depending on the direction, with higher rates observed for movements in preferred directions. To quantify firing rates, researchers use various methods, including counting spikes within a fixed window or convolving the spike train with a kernel (such as a square or Gaussian kernel) to smooth out the data and estimate the underlying firing rate.

#### B. Temporal Modulation of Firing Rates

Neurons exhibit temporal modulation in their firing rates, with some neurons responding more strongly to certain stimuli or movements than others. This information can be carried by either slow modulations in the firing rate (rate coding) or rapid changes in spike probability (temporal coding).

The brain uses both fast and slow timescales for information processing, and the relevant timescale depends on the specific computation being performed and the biophysical mechanisms involved.
