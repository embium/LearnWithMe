### I. Introduction to Receptive Fields
#### A. Definition and Importance

Receptive fields are a fundamental concept in understanding how sensory systems process information. They refer to the region of the sensory periphery where neurons receive input, and their response to different stimuli within that area. The idea was first explored by Hubel and Wiesel through early experiments demonstrating how neurons in the visual cortex respond to visual stimuli.

#### B. Early Experiments and Mapping Receptive Fields

Hubel and Wiesel's experiments involved presenting a cat with various visual patterns, such as spots or bars of light, while recording from neurons in the visual cortex. By analyzing the responses, they were able to map out the receptive field for each neuron, identifying areas where the neuron would spike in response to different stimuli. This pioneering work laid the foundation for understanding how sensory systems process information.

### II. Spatial and Temporal Receptive Fields
#### A. Spatial Receptive Fields

The process of finding receptive fields involves correlating the stimulus with the neural response. In the spatial domain, this is achieved through a correlation operation between the receptive field and the stimulus intensity profile. The output of this linear filter is then added to a spontaneous firing rate to obtain the firing rate of the neuron.

#### B. Temporal Receptive Fields

The concept can be extended to the temporal domain by considering a stimulus that varies over time. The temporal receptive field is obtained by convolving the stimulus with a linear kernel, which represents the neural response to different time-varying stimuli.

### III. Spatial-Temporal Receptive Fields (STRFs)
#### A. Definition and Significance

In reality, neurons are sensitive to both spatial and temporal aspects of their environment. A spatial-temporal receptive field (STRF) combines these two concepts into a single framework. This allows for the analysis of how neurons respond to complex stimuli that vary over space and time.

#### B. Understanding STRFs

The STRF can be thought of as a 2D function that represents the neural response to different positions and times within the stimulus. This concept is crucial in understanding how neurons process information from complex stimuli.

### IV. Separability of Receptive Fields
#### A. Definition and Importance

The separability of receptive fields refers to whether they can be decomposed into separate spatial and temporal components. If a receptive field is separable, it means that its spatial and temporal aspects can be analyzed independently. This property is useful in understanding how neurons process information from complex stimuli.

### V. Applications and Implications
#### A. Spike-Triggered Averaging

The concept of a receptive field is crucial in understanding how neurons respond to sensory stimuli. A receptive field is essentially a function that describes how a neuron's firing rate changes in response to different stimuli. When a stimulus varies slowly, it doesn't have the fast fluctuations needed to activate the neuron, making it an ideal stimulus for extracting the receptive field.

#### B. Spike-Triggered Average and Sensory Processing

Spike-triggered averaging is a powerful tool for extracting receptive fields in early sensory areas, where it can be used to identify different types of retinal ganglion cells responding to specific visual features. By analyzing the activity of these cells, researchers can understand how they contribute to higher-level processing and perception.

#### C. Applications Beyond Vision

The concept of receptive fields is not limited to vision. The auditory system can also be mapped using similar methods. A microphone signal fluctuates due to air pressure changes, with high and low frequency components that can be computed as a Fourier transform. This results in a spectrogram showing frequency over time, with intensity indicating energy at specific frequencies.

#### D. Understanding Neural Responses

Neurons respond to stimuli like this, such as a canary song, by activating to different sounds. By playing noisy stimuli in auditory space and recording neuron spikes, researchers can identify the spectral temporal patterns of stimuli that trigger each spike. Averaging these snapshots reveals the receptive field of the neuron, which can be complex in frequency and time.

#### E. Mathematical Models and Receptive Fields

These findings demonstrate how neurons have selective responses to specific patterns of sensory inputs, which can be described using mathematical models and extracted through spike-triggered averages.
