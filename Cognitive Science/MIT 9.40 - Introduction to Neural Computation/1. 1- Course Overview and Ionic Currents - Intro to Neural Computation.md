### I. Introduction to Neural Computation
#### A. Overview of the Field's Evolution

Neural computation has transitioned from a descriptive field, where researchers focused on detailing different types of neurons and their functions, to an engineering-based approach. This shift aims to understand how brain systems and circuits work by developing mathematical models of neural components and circuits. Recent technological advancements in imaging systems and microscopes have enabled the simultaneous recording of thousands of neurons, generating high-dimensional data sets that require sophisticated analysis techniques.

#### B. Challenges and Opportunities

One significant challenge is relating these large data sets to circuit models, which involves dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition. Researchers are developing mathematical tools to analyze this data and relate it to neural circuits, with applications in understanding brain function, cognition, and behavior. This course aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle these challenges.

### II. Biophysics of Neurons and Networks
#### A. Diffusion and Transport in Cells

Cells have to overcome the limitations of diffusion in three dimensions by using alternative methods to transport substances over long distances. Analyzing one-dimensional diffusion helps us understand why cells use this method. By examining how particles diffuse from a starting point, we can see that their distribution spreads out, with some ending up on the left and others on the right.

#### B. Gaussian Distribution and Diffusion

The distribution of particles that starts at zero and diffuses in 1D is Gaussian due to the equal probability of moving left or right. By analyzing this process further, we can calculate the average position and variance of the particles over time. We find that the variance grows linearly with time, and the standard deviation (distance from the starting point) grows as the square root of time.

#### C. Limitations of Diffusion

For small molecules, it takes a significant amount of time to diffuse a certain distance. For example, it would take 50 milliseconds to diffuse 10 microns and 10 minutes to diffuse 1 millimeter. However, if we were to ask how long it takes to diffuse a meter, the answer would be around 10 years. This is why neurons and cells have to go to great lengths to overcome this limitation.

### III. Electrical Properties of Cells
#### A. Fick's First Law and Ion Movement

The movement of ions from areas of high concentration to low concentration produces a net flow, known as Fick's first law. This concept is fundamental to how neurons work and will be built upon in future lectures.

#### B. Ohm's Law and Electrical Conduction

In the presence of voltage differences, current flow obeys Ohm's law, which states that current is proportional to voltage difference and inversely proportional to resistance. The drift velocity (velocity of particles due to an electric field) is proportional to the force (electric field), and the current is proportional to the drift velocity times the area.

#### C. Resistance and Conductivity

The intracellular extracellular solution has a resistance of 60 ohms, which is significantly higher than the 1.6 microohms found outside cells. This means that sending current through the solution requires huge voltage drops to produce tiny currents. As a result, the brain uses axons and action potentials to send signals over short distances.

#### D. Mean Free Path and Electrical Properties

The mean free path of particles inside cells is shorter than outside, contributing to the higher resistivity, which is approximately 2000 ohms per centimeter or 110 ohms per millimeter within a cell. This property affects the behavior of charged particles and concentration gradients in the brain, leading to unique electrical properties that are essential to understand for grasping the underlying physics of neural function.

### IV. Course Goals and Objectives
#### A. Understanding Neural Circuits

This course aims to equip students with a deep understanding of how neural circuits work, including the biophysics of neurons and networks.

#### B. Developing Mathematical Tools

Students will learn about mathematical techniques for analyzing models and data, as well as develop skills in using MATLAB to simulate and analyze neural systems.

#### C. Applying Skills to Real-World Problems

The course goals include applying these skills to real-world problems, such as studying brain function and behavior, and understanding the underlying physics of neural function.
