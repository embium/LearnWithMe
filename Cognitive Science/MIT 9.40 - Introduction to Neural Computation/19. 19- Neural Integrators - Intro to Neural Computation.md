### I. Neural Recurrent Neural Networks: Building on RNNs
#### A. Introduction to Neural Integrators

Neural integrators are crucial models in neuroscience that serve as the most important representation of short-term memory. Unlike long-term memories, which can span hours, days, or even a lifetime, short-term memories last only seconds to tens of seconds at most. The capacity of short-term memory is limited, with a typical number being around seven items, exemplified by the classic "seven plus or minus two" concept.

Short-term memory involves the persistent firing of neurons in a particular population, whereas long-term memories are thought to be supported by physical changes in neurons and their synapses. A typical short-term memory task involves an animal maintaining fixation on a screen while one cue turns on, requiring the animal to remember which cue was activated later.

#### B. Biophysical Mechanism Underlying Short-Term Memory

Research has shown that neural activity in parts of the prefrontal cortex is quiet during the initial period but ramps up quickly and maintains persistent activity during the delay period. This persistent activity is thought to be the neural basis of short-term memory maintenance. A particular neuron's activity carries information about which cue was active, with different neurons in the population having distinct preferred directions.

#### C. Neural Integrators in Accumulating Information

Neural integrators are also involved in accumulating information over time, particularly in tasks where noisy stimuli require prolonged observation to discern patterns or trends. In such cases, neural activity ramps up as evidence accumulates, eventually reaching a threshold that triggers a decision. The weaker the evidence, the slower the accumulation and longer the reaction time.

Examples of behaviors thought to involve integration include:

*   Navigation by path integration in desert ants, which maintain knowledge of their nest's direction despite navigating through complex environments.
*   Neural integrators controlling eye position in goldfish, with neurons integrating bursts of activity from saccade burst generator neurons to produce a persistent signal that maintains eye position.

#### D. Developing a Neural Model for Integration

A neural model can be developed to simulate this integration process by creating a network with recurrent connections and analyzing its behavior using a method involving a recurrent weight matrix. By making the feedback from other neurons balance the intrinsic leak, the neuron's activity becomes an integrator of its input.

To achieve this, most eigenvalues should be less than one, but one eigenvalue should be close to one. In this case, one mode of the network becomes an integrating mode, while all other modes have activity that decays away rapidly. This allows for a single mode to integrate input over time, with its activity obeying a differential equation where the feedback balances the leak.

#### E. Neural Integrator Network in the Brain

The neural integrator network in the brain takes burst inputs, integrates them, and produces persistent changes in activity that drive eye movements. This network has a single eigenvalue of one, corresponding to an integrating mode, while other modes have eigenvalues less than one or negative.

A similar mechanism can be used to store short-term memories of continuously graded variables like eye position. Next time we'll discuss using recurrent networks with eigenvalues greater than one as a way of storing short-term discreet memories, known as hopfield networks.
