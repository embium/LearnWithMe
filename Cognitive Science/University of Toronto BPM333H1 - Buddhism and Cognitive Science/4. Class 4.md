### I. The Collapse of Traditional Orders
#### A. Ancient Greece: Conformity Theory and Geocentric Worldview

In ancient Greece, Aristotle's worldview was based on conformity theory, where knowledge is achieved by sharing form between the mind and reality. This led to a geocentric world view, where things move purposefully towards their destinations. The concept of **conformity theory** implies that there is an inherent order in the universe, which can be understood through reason and observation.

Aristotle's ideas had a profound impact on Western thought, shaping the way people understood the natural world and their place within it. However, this worldview also led to a rigid and unyielding understanding of reality, where things were seen as moving towards predetermined destinations rather than being in constant flux.

#### B. The Christian Worldview: Integration with Narrative Order

The Christian worldview emerged as an integration of Aristotle's purposeful universe with a narrative order, emphasizing love and agape as the core of human desire to know and understand. This integration led to a more nuanced understanding of reality, where things were seen as being in motion towards their destinations, but also subject to the will of God.

The Christian worldview placed a strong emphasis on **love** and **agape**, which became central to human understanding and experience. However, this integration also led to a fragmentation of reason and love, with faith becoming a strong belief based on the will rather than reason.

#### C. Medieval Period: Thomas Aquinas and the Reconciliation of Science and Spirituality

In the medieval period, Thomas Aquinas attempted to reconcile Aristotle's science with Christianity by mapping the two worlds onto each other. However, this led to a fragmentation of reason and love, with faith becoming a strong belief based on the will rather than reason.

Aquinas' reconciliation of science and spirituality set the stage for future conflicts between rational inquiry and spiritual pursuits. The separation of science and spirituality would have far-reaching consequences, contributing to the modern crisis of meaning.

### II. The Bubonic Plague and the Breakdown of Feudalism
#### A. Labor Shortages and Individual Agency

The Bubonic plague that ravaged Europe in the 14th century further destabilized the social order, leading to labor shortages and the breakdown of feudalism. As people gained more freedom to choose their course, individual agency and self-determination became increasingly emphasized.

The rise of gnosticism, as seen in the Cathars, also challenged the two-worlds model by portraying this world as a prison created by an evil conspiracy. This idea would have significant implications for Western thought, contributing to the modern crisis of meaning.

#### B. The Emergence of Individualism and Self-Determination

The breakdown of feudalism led to the emergence of individualism and self-determination, where people began to see themselves as self-made and in control of their destinies. This shift would have far-reaching consequences, contributing to the rise of commercialism and the development of new psycho-technologies.

### III. The Modern Crisis of Meaning
#### A. Science and Spirituality: Opposing Forces

The modern crisis of meaning is characterized by a complete collapse of connections between individuals, society, and the world, leaving only a solitary self-consciousness that is disconnected from all else. This crisis has been unfolding over centuries, with cognitive science emerging as a key area of study in response to it.

The history of cognitive science is deeply intertwined with the meaning crisis, and addressing one will likely involve engaging with the other. The concept of zombies has become a cultural representation of society's meaning crisis, often conjoined with the idea of an apocalypse.

#### B. The Protestant Reformation: Salvation through Faith

The Protestant Reformation responded to this crisis by asserting that salvation is solely through faith, not works or human effort. This idea was deeply tied to the notion that our value and worth are externally conveyed, rather than being intrinsic.

However, this emphasis on individualism and faith led to a devaluation of communal and spiritual practices, such as monasticism. The Protestant Reformation also contributed to the separation of church and state, with Luther advocating for the suppression of peasant revolts in Germany.

#### C. The Rise of Commercialism and Psycho-Technologies

The Protestant Reformation's emphasis on individual conscience and faith ultimately gave people their first real taste of democracy, influencing the English Revolution and the American system. However, this shift also contributed to a cultural training for narcissism, where individuals constantly seek external validation and attention to compensate for their lack of intrinsic value.

The rise of commercialism and psycho-technologies further contributed to the sense of disconnection and meaninglessness. Advances in math and astronomy led to a greater understanding of celestial mechanics, but also introduced new complexities and uncertainties, such as the retrograde motion of Mars.

#### D. The Collapse of Traditional Institutions

Ultimately, the meaning crisis is characterized by a complete collapse of connections between individuals, society, and the world, leaving only a solitary self-consciousness that is disconnected from all else. This crisis has been unfolding over centuries, with cognitive science emerging as a key area of study in response to it.

The history of cognitive science is deeply intertwined with the meaning crisis, and addressing one will likely involve engaging with the other. The concept of zombies has become a cultural representation of society's meaning crisis, often conjoined with the idea of an apocalypse.
