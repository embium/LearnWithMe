### I. The Collapse of the Axial Structure
#### A. Introduction to the Crisis in Meaning

The collapse of the axial structure, inherited from ancient Israel and Greece, began with Aquinas' reconfiguration of the two-world model. This separation led to a crisis in meaning, as spirituality became disconnected from reason and situated within will. The emphasis on God's Will was taken up by the Reimann mystics, who emphasized understanding love in its connections with Will rather than reason.

#### B. The Rise of Commercialism and Its Impact

The rise of commercialism brought new mathematical technologies, such as Hindu-Arabic numerals and algebra, which improved celestial navigation and revealed the heavens' disorderly behavior. Copernicus' heliocentric model further severed the mind from the world, rendering experience illusory. Galileo integrated math with experimental methods, discovering inertial motion and undermining purpose in the universe.

#### C. The Protestant Reformation and Its Consequences

The Protestant Reformation, influenced by the Reimann mystics, internalized these ideas, leading to Luther's concept of a radically self-obsessed and self-hating self. This resulted in an inner conflict that defined human nature, with attempts at self-transcendence seen as pride and sin. The separation of church and state allowed for democracy, but also drove capitalism and science.

#### D. Descartes' Philosophy and the Crisis in Meaning

Descartes' philosophical understanding of the mind as computation attempted to reconnect with reality, but ultimately disconnected mind from body, world, and itself. This led to a crisis in meaning, as the three orders connecting humans to reality were undermined: the Ian connection collapse, the restless narcissistic self, and the sapal obsolescence.

### II. The Zombie Apocalypse
#### A. Introduction to the Metaphorical Crisis

The zombie apocalypse represents this meting crisis. Zombies are a perversion of Christian symbolism, representing a complete loss of meaning-making capacity. They lack intelligence, possess no supernatural force, and have no plan or goal. The zombie's existence is coextensive with an apocalypse, where civilization ends, and there is no final revelation.

#### B. Secularization of the Apocalypse

The association of zombies with apocalypse reflects a secularization of the Apocalypse idea, where the old world must be broken for a new order to emerge. The zombie's lack of intelligence, supernatural force, or plan mirrors humanity's current state, where people are worn down by constant attrition and unable to build an alternative structure.

#### C. Cultural Significance

The concept of apocalypse, particularly through the lens of zombie movies, reveals a deeper crisis - the meaning crisis. This phenomenon began in the 9th century with the Martian invasion narrative, where superior technology represented a secular apocalypse, only to be defeated by microbes seen as a sign of God's Providence.

### III. The Crisis and Its Implications
#### A. Reconnection of Scientific Knowledge and Wisdom Cultivation

To address this crisis, we need a reconnection of scientific knowledge with wisdom cultivation, which was severed in the West. Cognitive science can play a role in this by providing an account of how different levels of cognition interact.

#### B. Philosophy's Role in Addressing the Crisis

Philosophy has a crucial role in cognitive science as it bridges disparate discourses and creates integrated vocabularies, allowing for conceptual innovation and new theoretical landscapes. However, philosophy's true purpose is to cultivate wisdom by breaking down conceptual barriers and facilitating insightful interactions between disciplines.

#### C. Synoptic Integration and Interdisciplinary Eclecticism

Cognitive science seeks to develop a unified understanding of the causal interactions between different levels of cognition, allowing for a deeper comprehension of how these levels influence each other. In contrast, generic nominalism views cognitive science as merely a label for individual disciplines, with no inherent connection or integration between them.

#### D. The Concept of Metaphor and Synoptic Integration

The concept of metaphor is central to this process, as it allows us to create new connections between seemingly disparate ideas and facilitate insightful integration. By developing a construct that can be transferred across different domains, scientists can integrate previously disconnected areas of study, leading to a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. The Pursuit of Elegance in Scientific Inquiry

The pursuit of elegance in scientific inquiry involves integrating multiple disciplines, affording convergence between independent sense information, and increasing trustworthiness. This is achieved through the creation of profound constructs that make sense, are plausible, and have magnitude.

#### B. Satisfying the Naturalistic Imperative

Cognitive science aims to create profound constructs that integrate across disciplines, facilitating reconstrual information and mutual transformation. The goal is not only to explain how we generate scientific explanations but also to give a scientific naturalistic explanation of cognition, consciousness, and the mind.

#### C. Transforming Human Experience through Wisdom-Enhancing Psycho-Technologies

The naturalistic imperative is not only about explaining cognition but also about transforming it through wisdom-enhancing psycho-technologies, potentially integrating with Buddhism to create a more authentic and compassionate understanding of the mind.
