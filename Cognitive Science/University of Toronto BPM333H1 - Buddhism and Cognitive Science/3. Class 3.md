### I. The Axial Revolution's Impact on Greece
#### A. Socrates' Career and the Meaning Crisis

The Axial Revolution had a profound impact on ancient Greek society, particularly with regards to the concept of truth and relevance. Socrates, a key figure from this period, played a significant role in addressing the meaning crisis that arose during this time. He opposed two groups: the natural philosophers, whom he respected for their rational method but found lacking in existential relevance, and the sophists, who emphasized rhetoric over truth.

Socrates was particularly concerned with bullshitting, which undermines confidence in cultural systems and facilitates self-deception. In contrast, he sought a way to keep truth and relevance mutually dependent, which he called "significance." This emphasis on significance is central to his philosophy, as seen in his method of questioning, which reveals the limitations necessary for avoiding self-deception.

#### B. Socrates' Method and the Limitations of Self-Deception

Socrates' approach was distinct from that of the sophists, who prioritized relevance over truth. His ideas were later internalized by Plato, who proposed a psychological theory involving multiple centers of processing, including a rational part and an impulsive monster-like entity. This theory foreshadowed modern psychology's understanding of multiple systems of processing.

Socrates' emphasis on significance and the importance of avoiding self-deception are key aspects of his philosophy, which was later developed by Plato and other Greek thinkers. The Conformity Theory of knowledge suggests that when we know something, our mind shares the same structural functional organization as the thing known. This idea is central to understanding how we perceive and interact with reality.

### II. Ancient Greece's Conceptual Framework
#### A. Aristotle's Potentiality and Actuality

Aristotle's concept of potentiality and actuality is crucial in this context, where potentiality refers to the capacity for development or change, while actuality represents the fully realized state of being. The Conformity Theory implies that our minds conform to the structural functional organization of reality, allowing us to directly understand its structure.

This understanding provides a justification for the idea that everything is acting on purpose, trying to come to fulfillment. In this worldview, everything has a place and a purpose, and we can have an intimate knowledge of reality due to the way our minds work in conjunction with it.

#### B. Plato's Theory of Ascent and Aristotle's Theory of Development

The integration of Plato's theory of ascent and Aristotle's theory of development by Plotinus creates a grand unified field theory of ancient thought, where the two are deeply interwoven together. This integrated view sees knowledge as a transformative process that changes the structural functional organization of the mind, making us more like what we know.

### III. Ancient India's Axial Revolution
#### A. The Concept of Evil and Self-Transformation

The concept of evil has been a longstanding concern, with ancient cultures attempting to explain its presence. In one such culture, a philosopher's words inspired an ideal that emphasized actuality over potentiality, where actuality is defined as the degree to which something is integrated and can be understood.

This idea was later developed by another philosopher who argued that evil is a lack of form, a lack of actuality, and a source of chaos. In this context, evil is seen as a real thing with its own reality, allowing for an explanation of why it exists in the world.

#### B. Mindfulness and Self-Transformation

A personal experience of trauma led to a philosophical exploration of evil, where the concept was linked to internal conflict and the desire for goodness. This idea was further developed by another philosopher who introduced the notion of Agape, or unconditional love, as a means of resolving inner conflict and achieving goodness.

The integration of Agape into the narrative of history created a grand account of human existence, where every action is driven by an impulse to ascend towards what is real. This philosophical framework was later internalized by another philosopher who saw it as a personal and lived experience.

### IV. The Intersection of Cognitive Science and Buddhism
#### A. Mindfulness and Self-Transformation

The intersection of cognitive science and Buddhism highlighted the importance of attention-paying techniques in transforming human beings. These practices were aimed at transforming character, with mindfulness being seen as primarily about altering traits of character rather than creating Altered States Of Consciousness.

Mindfulness is often misunderstood as simply meditating, but it's actually about transforming one's consciousness and cognition through the activation of certain principles. This transformation allows individuals to see and exist in the world differently.

#### B. The Concept of Flow

The concept of flow is also relevant here, as it represents an optimal state of consciousness where attention is fully engaged with the task at hand. In this state, individuals experience heightened performance, creativity, and enjoyment. However, this state is often accompanied by a loss of self-consciousness, which can be seen as a form of ego transcendence.

Buddhism teaches that true agency and wisdom come from transcending the egocentric narrative self, which is the ultimate form of self-deception. This idea is closely tied to the concept of flow, where individuals experience a sense of unity with their environment and a loss of the nagging inner monologue.

### V. The Intersection of Psycho-Technologies
#### A. Mindfulness and Self-Transformation

The intersection of psycho-technologies from Buddhism and Western traditions reveals similarities and differences, with the former emphasizing self-transcendence and overcoming self-deception to move from the illusory world to the real one. This axial revolution offers a distinct approach that can make a difference by reconnecting us to a rich meaning and beautiful order lost in modern times.

#### B. The Goal of Mindfulness

Ultimately, mindfulness is about transforming one's consciousness and cognition through the activation of certain principles, allowing individuals to see and exist in the world differently. By embracing this transformation, people can enhance their agency, wisdom, and understanding of themselves and the world around them.

The goal of addressing anxiety and depression is not just to reduce pain or distress but to restore agency that has been lost due to excessive anxiety or depression. This involves stepping back from the automatic framing of reality in oneself and others, and instead, looking more deeply into things.

In Buddhism, this is achieved through contemplative practices such as mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, which involve dissolving the ego's narrative and default perception of the world. By doing so, one can gain insights not just in their consciousness but also out of it, leading to a fundamental transformation of how consciousness flows. This, in turn, changes the way agency is structured and trained, allowing for optimal functioning beyond the confines of the ego's narrative perspective.
