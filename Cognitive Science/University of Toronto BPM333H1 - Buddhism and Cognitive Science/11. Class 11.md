### I. The Concept of Domicide and Meaning Crisis
#### A. Introduction to Domicide

The concept of domicide refers to a comprehensive form of self-destruction that has been explored in various philosophical traditions to gain insight into the meaning crisis and perennial problems of perspectival knowing. This idea suggests that there are inherent problems with being a part of a perspectival learner, which can be addressed through psycho-technologies embedded in a sacredness landscape.

#### B. The Clos Thesis

The Clos thesis proposes that the inherent problems associated with being a part of a perspectival learner can be addressed by integrating psycho-technologies from Buddhism with cognitive science. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of human existence and the perennial problems that plague it, including the meaning crisis.

#### C. The Role of Psycho-Technologies

Psycho-technologies refer to the tools and practices used to transform one's religio (worldview) and enhance relevance realization. In the context of Buddhism, these technologies include meditation, contemplation, and other practices aimed at realizing non-duality and transcending the limitations of human existence.

### II. The Stoic Philosophers' Ideas on Anxiety and Modal Confusion
#### A. Addressing Anxiety and Modal Confusion

The Stoic philosophers have discussed the importance of addressing anxiety and modal confusion in achieving moral clarity and reducing biasing factors. This involves internalizing Socratic principles, cultivating wisdom, and training particular virtues.

#### B. The Concept of Modal Confusion

Modal confusion arises from inadequate attention to co-identification processes and the distinction between being needs and having needs. This can lead to a narrative understanding of life that is undermined by the universe's minimal responsiveness to our momentum.

### III. The Perennial Problem of Horror and Absurdity
#### A. Perspective Clash and Mystery

The perennial problem of horror and absurdity arises from perspective clash and the experience of mystery. Stoic philosopher Spinoza's ideas on creating a state of Scania into ativa, where there is no perspectival clash, have been mentioned as complemented by Buddhist meditative and contemplative practices that realize non-duality.

### IV. The Concept of Parasitic Processing
#### A. Self-Organizing Processes

The concept of parasitic processing refers to the self-organizing processes that make us intelligent but also susceptible to self-deceptive and self-destructive behavior. This process is linked to the idea of Dua, or suffering, in Buddhism, which is understood as a loss of agency rather than pain.

#### B. The Need for Counteractive Dynamical Systems

The need for a counteractive dynamical system to address parasitic processing has been emphasized, with the eightfold path being proposed as an example of such a system. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of human existence and the perennial problems that plague it.

### V. The Perennial Problem of Self-Undermining Meaning in Life
#### A. Integration Point

The perennial problem of self-undermining meaning in life is unique in that it makes use of perennial features of perspectival knowing but is particularly pertinent in the West due to historical factors. This problem is seen as an integration point, where other perennial problems co-occur and reinforce each other in a negative manifold.

#### B. Susan Wolf's Ideas on Meaning in Life

Susan Wolf has argued that people seek meaning beyond moral concerns, and that this desire is often metaphorical and cannot be satisfied by simply being connected to something else. Instead, people want to value something that has inherent value, independent of their own valuing.

### VI. The Integration of Buddhist Thought with Cognitive Science
#### A. Stephen Bachor's Work

Stephen Bachor's work in "Alone with Others" and "Buddhism without Beliefs" offers a more promising approach by arguing that the interpretation crisis and meaning crisis are interlocking, and that Buddhism should be understood as a religio for recovering the being mode, rather than a set of beliefs.

#### B. The Eightfold Path as a Guide

The eightfold path is often used as a guide to realizing enlightenment through a counteractive dynamical system that radically transforms one's religio. This creation of right whole sets of psycho-technologies and their explicit integration with each other into a dynamical system is internalized in conjunction with the goal of enhancing relevance realization.

### VII. The Concept of Emergence
#### A. Francisco Varela's Work

Francisco Varela's work on embodiment and embeddedness highlights the deep continuity between cognition and biology, suggesting that cognition deeply depends on biology for its energy and constitutive principles. This challenges traditional notions of identity and existence.

#### B. Self-Organizing Systems

The concept of emergence is central to this idea, as it suggests that complex systems have properties that their components do not have. Varela's interpretation of the Buddhist doctrine of an Atman suggests that there is no substantial self, but rather a virtual self that emerges from self-organization.

### VIII. The Notion of a Self-Organizing System
#### A. Challenges to Traditional Notions

The notion of a self-organizing system challenges traditional notions of identity and existence. This idea has implications for our understanding of consciousness, identity, and the nature of reality itself.

#### B. Research on Lucid Dreaming and the Third Man Factor

Research on lucid dreaming and the third man factor suggests that entities within dreams can exhibit independent awareness, sparking questions about the nature of consciousness.

### IX. The Cultivation of Character
#### A. Compensating Personality Flaws

The cultivation of character is essential for compensating personality flaws, and this concept aligns with Buddhist notions and cognitive science principles.

#### B. Emotions in Cognitive Agency

Emotions play a crucial role in cognitive agency, and positive psychology has shifted focus from pathology to excellence, highlighting wisdom as a form of excellence that reveals important properties of the mind when it excels beyond the norm.

### X. Conclusion
#### A. Integration with Cognitive Science

The integration of Buddhist thought with cognitive science has the potential to provide a more nuanced understanding of human existence and the perennial problems that plague it. This approach can help address the meaning crisis by providing a more fundamental transformation through the use of psycho-technologies.

#### B. The Concept of Emergence

The concept of emergence is central to this idea, as it suggests that complex systems have properties that their components do not have. This idea has implications for our understanding of consciousness, identity, and the nature of reality itself.
