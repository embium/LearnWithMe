### I. The Axial Revolution: A Fundamental Change in Human Understanding
#### A. Overview of the Axial Revolution

The Axial Revolution, which occurred from 800 BCE to 300 BCE in ancient civilizations such as Greece, Israel, and India, marked a significant shift in how human beings understood themselves, the cosmos, and their place within it. Prior to this revolution, people lived in a continuous cosmos where differences between the natural world, social world, and divine world were largely undifferentiated. Wisdom was primarily understood as practical knowledge for gaining power and prosperity.

#### B. The Collapse of Empires and the Emergence of New Psycho-Technologies

The collapse of large empires around 1176 BCE created space for smaller groups to experiment with new social, political, and cultural organizations. This period saw the invention of psycho-technologies, such as alphabetic literacy, which massively increased cognitive power by externalizing cognition and enabling distributed thinking. The promotion of an idea of two worlds - one beset by illusion and deception, and another real world - led to a reinterpretation of human existence.

#### C. The Impact on Time and Morality

In ancient Israel, the understanding of time through narrative became a powerful psycho-technology that broke with the pre-Axial idea of time being in a circle. This allowed for the concept of progress, moral choice, and the importance of individual actions in shaping history. The Christian notion of agape, or creative love, transformed the ancient world by offering a new kind of wisdom that connected individuals to the course of history.

#### D. The Separation of Moral Claims from Purity Codes

The Axial Revolution also led to the separation of moral claims from purity codes, with guilt becoming more important than shame as moral choices became more significant. This development contributed to feelings of futility and disorientation in individuals who felt they had not acted morally or made the best choices in their lives.

### II. The Socratic Revolution: A Particular Expression of the Axial Revolution
#### A. Overview of the Socratic Revolution

The Socratic Revolution, which took place in ancient Greece, marked a particular way in which the Axial Revolution took root. Socrates' emphasis on second-order thinking and critical reflection led to a tension between oral culture and writing, with some philosophers like Plato being critical of writing's impact.

#### B. The Impact on Verbal Storytelling

The Axial Revolution also had an impact on verbal storytelling, with evidence of difficulty in ancient Greece. Socrates' method of questioning and dialogue was designed to help individuals develop second-order thinking and become aware of their own biases and limitations.

### III. The Three Orders: Cosmos, Community, and Self
#### A. Overview of the Three Orders

The Axial Revolution laid the groundwork for the creation of three orders that would give people a sense of connection and meaning: the cosmos, the community, and the self. These orders would become increasingly important as human civilization evolved, influencing the development of science, philosophy, and spirituality.

#### B. The Cosmos Order

The cosmos order refers to our understanding of the universe and its workings. This order is characterized by a sense of awe and wonder at the vastness and complexity of creation.

#### C. The Community Order

The community order refers to our relationships with others and our place within society. This order is characterized by a sense of belonging and connection to others.

#### D. The Self Order

The self order refers to our individual identity and sense of self. This order is characterized by a sense of autonomy and agency.

### IV. Plato's Theory of the Human Psyche
#### A. Overview of Plato's Theory

Plato proposed a psychological theory that explains why our motivation often exceeds our understanding, attributing it to an inner conflict between different motivational systems. He identified three centers: a monster-like part driven by short-term goals, a man-like part representing abstract truth, and a lion-like part symbolizing socialization and internalization of others' perspectives.

#### B. The Allegory of the Cave

Plato used the allegory of the cave to illustrate how one can move from a false world to a real world by internalizing Socrates' perspective and gaining wisdom. He proposed that we have two fundamental desires: one for inner peace through self-awareness, and another for truth and reality.

#### C. The Dynamic Creative Set of Connections

Plato believed that the pursuit of meaning involves an inner structuring of the psyche and a deep connection to reality, overcoming self-deception and self-destruction. This is achieved by structuring things in the right way within and without, allowing our desires for inner peace and connection to realness to be most real.

### V. The Narrative Sense of Meaning
#### A. Overview of the Narrative Sense

The narrative sense of what meaning is has been influenced by Greek thought, particularly Plato's concept of anagog or Ascent, which explores how we move from a lower state to a higher one through transformation and improvement.

#### B. The Three Orders Underlying Our Conceptions of Meaning

Three orders underlie our conceptions of meaning: the narrative order, exemplified by ancient Israelites and Christians; the nomological order, which seeks underlying principles, as developed by Aristotle; and the normative order, oriented towards what is good or best, allowing us to improve and connect with ourselves and the world.

#### C. The Crisis of Meaning

The human mind is wired to imitate, as seen in children who repeat actions without fully understanding their purpose. This ability to imitate allows for internalization, where one person's perspective becomes another's, leading to growth and development of the mind. However, this crisis has led to a loss of meaning and a sense of disorientation in individuals.

### VI. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of the Axial Revolution

The Axial Revolution marked a fundamental change in human understanding, shifting from a continuous cosmos to a differentiated world with distinct orders: the cosmos, community, and self. This revolution led to the emergence of new psycho-technologies, such as alphabetic literacy, and transformed our understanding of time, morality, and the human psyche.

#### B. The Importance of Meaning

The pursuit of meaning involves an inner structuring of the psyche and a deep connection to reality, overcoming self-deception and self-destruction. This is achieved by structuring things in the right way within and without, allowing our desires for inner peace and connection to realness to be most real.

#### C. The Way Forward

The human mind is wired to imitate, but this ability can also lead to a crisis of meaning. By understanding why it's important and how to improve it, we can move towards a more authentic and meaningful life.
