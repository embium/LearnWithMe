### I. Relevance Realization: A Fundamental Aspect of Cognitive Science
#### A. Overview of Relevance Realization

Relevance realization is a complex process that underlies our understanding of the world. It involves determining what information is relevant to our comprehension, taking into account emotional and affective states, self-organization, and transcendence. This process cannot be reduced to mere representations or computations, as it requires a deeper level of processing that involves context, intentionality, and the ability to break out of inappropriate framing and reframe our understanding of reality.

#### B. Key Characteristics of Relevance Realization

Relevance realization is inherently sub-representational, meaning it cannot be captured using traditional computational or representational models. It is also pre-rational, pre-experiential, and pre-logical, making it challenging to understand using conventional frameworks. The process involves self-organization, transcendence, and the ability to recognize and respond to relevance in a highly coupled fashion.

#### C. Connection to Consciousness, Insight, and Wonder

Relevance realization is deeply connected to consciousness, insight, and wonder. It cannot be reduced to mere computational or representational processes, but rather requires a nuanced understanding of this complex process. The concept of intrinsic existence is crucial in understanding the nature of scientific inquiry, as it highlights the limitations of seeking a final or absolute theory of relevance.

#### D. Implications for Understanding the Mind and Scientific Inquiry

The realization that relevance is not a property of things but an evolving process that adapts to changing contexts has significant implications for our understanding of the mind and its ability to generate theories about itself. The analogy between biological evolution and relevance realization suggests that the brain's problem-solving abilities are constantly evolving, much like species adapt to their environments.

### II. Causation and Constraints
#### A. Understanding Causation

Causation is often misunderstood as being solely about events, but in reality, it involves both causes and constraints. A cause is an event that acts in a certain way to make things happen, whereas a constraint is a condition that alters possibility by making some outcomes more or less probable.

#### B. Actual vs. Potential

The distinction between actuality and potentiality is crucial here, with actuality referring to what exists, and potentiality referring to what could exist. If we equate actuality with reality, then possibility becomes unreal, which would render science meaningless since it relies on possibilities to explain phenomena like the conservation of energy.

#### C. Darwin's Theory of Evolution

Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection can be seen as a dynamical systems theory that uses both causation and constraints to explain how species adapt and evolve over time. The theory involves a feedback loop where organisms reproduce, and their variations are shaped by selective constraints like scarcity, which limits options, and enabling constraints like variation, which increases possibilities.

### III. Relevance Realization as a Resource-Based Process
#### A. Understanding the Brain's Interactions with its Environment

The brain's interactions with its environment are shaped by two types of constraints: efficiency, which seeks to maintain homeostasis, and resiliency, which ensures the brain can adapt to changes and keep options open.

#### B. Generalization and Specialization in the Brain

The brain achieves a balance between efficiency and resiliency through a process called exaptation, where existing functions are repurposed for new tasks. This ability to generalize and specialize is essential for intelligence, as it enables the brain to integrate information, make predictions, and differentiate between things.

#### C. Network Theory and Relevance Realization

The brain's functioning can be understood through network theory, which studies connections between nodes. A small-world network, characterized by a balance between efficiency and resiliency, is ideal for relevance realization, the core of intelligence. Measures of how much the brain wires like this have been found to be predictive of intelligence.

### IV. The Process of Insight
#### A. Transformation from Regular to Small-World Network

A regular network transforms into a small-world network when one of its connections is broken or altered, forming a long-distance connection. This transformation, known as Insight, leads to significant efficiency gains and minimal loss of resiliency.

#### B. Self-Organizing Criticality and Relevance Realization

The process of self-organizing criticality allows the brain to reconfigure itself to create a more effective problem-solving machine. As it evolves, the network alters its connections and information processing, allowing for improved relevance realization and trustworthiness.

#### C. Features of Insight and Relevance Realization

Insight is at the core of various features such as meaning, wisdom, self-transcendence, and relevance realization, which are central to addressing the meaning crisis.
