### I. Problem Solving Fundamentals
#### A. Introduction to Problem Solving

Problem solving is a crucial aspect that can be applied to various situations, including achieving goals. It involves overcoming obstacles or reaching specific criteria. While problem-solving abilities may seem unique to humans, animals like pigeons, crows, and monkeys have also demonstrated these capabilities.

#### B. Strategies for Effective Problem Solving

There are several strategies that individuals can employ to tackle complex problems effectively:

*   **Hill Climbing Strategy**: This mental shortcut involves making progress towards a solution without revisiting previous steps. However, it can be flawed when faced with complex problems like the classic "chicken, grain, and fox" puzzle.
*   **Means Analysis**: This approach involves identifying sub-goals and prioritizing them to solve larger problems. For instance, in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, breaking down the problem into smaller components and focusing on getting one disk across first can lead to a solution.

#### C. The Role of Experience in Problem Solving

Experience plays a significant role in problem solving, as individuals often rely on past experiences to tackle similar problems. This is because experience allows people to develop a deeper understanding of how different factors interact and influence each other.

#### D. Analogies and Relational Mindset

Analogies are another useful tool for problem solving, where individuals draw comparisons between seemingly unrelated ideas to find solutions. By recognizing the deep structure of problems and focusing on common principles, individuals can develop a relational mindset that helps them think about relationships between items and principles.

### II. Overcoming Obstacles in Problem Solving
#### A. Functional Fixedness

Functional fixedness is a tendency to think about objects in only one set way. This can lead to creative solutions being overlooked. For example, using the box of matches as a frame or ledge for the candle in the problem presented, rather than just thinking of it as a container for tacks.

#### B. Problem Sets and Mindset

The concept of problem sets, or how individuals view problems, is also important. Our mindset can be a major obstacle to solving them. A quote from Abraham Maslow highlights this point: "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." This emphasizes how our experiences and tools can influence our approach to problems.

#### C. The Importance of Creativity in Problem-Solving

Creativity plays a vital role in problem-solving, involving thinking outside the box and making novel connections between ideas. It allows individuals to find innovative solutions that might not have been considered otherwise.

### III. Intelligence and Cognitive Development
#### A. Evolution of IQ Measurement

The traditional single-score measure of intelligence quotient (IQ) is now considered outdated. Researchers focus on fluid intelligence, which involves quick thinking and problem-solving skills, and crystallized intelligence, which encompasses acquired knowledge and book smarts.

#### B. Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence

Fluid intelligence peaks in adolescence and declines with age, while crystallized intelligence remains relatively stable. Vocabulary tests are an exception, as people's vocabulary tends to improve over time.

#### C. Environmental Factors and Cognitive Development

Environmental factors also play a role in shaping IQ, with children from high socioeconomic backgrounds showing significant gains after adoption, whereas those from low socioeconomic backgrounds experience little change. This highlights the importance of understanding how environment influences cognitive development and intelligence.
