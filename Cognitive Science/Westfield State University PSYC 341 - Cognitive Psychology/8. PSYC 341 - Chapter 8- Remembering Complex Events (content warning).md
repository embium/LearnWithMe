### I. Remembering Complex Events
#### A. Introduction to Emotion's Role in Memory

Emotions play a significant role in shaping our memories, particularly when it comes to complex events. Our framework for understanding the world can influence what we remember, and emotions are a crucial factor in this process. In this chapter, we will explore how emotions affect memory, situation influences memory, and the creation of false memories.

#### B. Emotion Affecting Memory

Emotions have a profound impact on our ability to recall events. When we experience strong emotions during an event, it can enhance our memory by providing salient details and fitting into levels of processing, making events more meaningful and memorable. However, research has shown that these memories are susceptible to misattribution, corruption, and retrieval errors, similar to everyday memories.

*   A study on flashbulb memories found that people's confidence in remembering traumatic events increased over time, but their accuracy did not necessarily improve.
*   The Mandela effect is a phenomenon where people remember events or facts differently, often due to confirmation bias and the influence of social information.

#### C. Situation Influencing Memory

The situation in which we experience an event can also impact our memory recall. Research has shown that eyewitness testimonies can be unreliable due to the creation of false memories through suggestive interviews and manipulation of evidence.

*   A classic study by Loftus and Palmer in 1974 demonstrated how different wording in questions can affect memory recall, with participants reporting slower speeds for a car crash when asked about "bumped" rather than "smashed."
*   The brain's hippocampus plays a crucial role in consolidating memories, but it can also be influenced by external factors, leading to false memories.

#### D. Creation of False Memories

False memories are a complex phenomenon that can arise from various factors such as suggestion, intimidation, and the words used to ask about events. Research has shown that eyewitness testimonies can be unreliable due to the creation of false memories through these means.

*   Elizabeth Loftus's research has demonstrated how easily false memories can be created through suggestive interviews and manipulation of evidence.
*   The concept of spreading activation and schemas further illustrates how our brains can create false memories by activating associations with related words or concepts.

#### E. Interference Theory

Interference theory explains how incoming memories can overwrite old ones, leading to false memories. This concept is further illustrated by examples such as the Berenstain Bears, Oscar Mayer, and Shazam/Kazam, which demonstrate how our brains can create false memories through interference and decay.

*   When discussing interference and decay in memory, two concepts that occur due to both processes are neural explanations.
*   Interference happens when new connections replace old ones or when heavily used neurons disrupt the formation of new connections, while decay refers to the forgetting that occurs over time.

#### F. Memory Across Species

Research has shown that human and non-human memories share similar characteristics, such as unlimited capacity, with some studies suggesting that pigeons can remember up to 1,000 stimuli, comparable to dogs and humans.

*   A study from the 80s compared short-term memory functions in birds, monkeys, and humans, finding that all three exhibit primacy and recency effects, but with differences based on the timeline of questions being asked.
*   This suggests that memory obeys similar laws across species, with variations in how well we can access and recall memories over time.

#### G. Conclusion

In conclusion, remembering complex events is a multifaceted process influenced by emotions, situations, and false memories. Our framework for understanding the world can change what we remember, particularly when it comes to emotional experiences and schemas - mental frameworks that help us understand and navigate everyday situations. By understanding these factors, we can better appreciate the complexities of human memory and its susceptibility to influence.
