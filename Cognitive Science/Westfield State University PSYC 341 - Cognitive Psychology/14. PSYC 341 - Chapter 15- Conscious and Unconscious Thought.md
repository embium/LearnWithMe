### I. Consciousness and Unconsciousness: Understanding Thoughts
#### A. Introduction to Consciousness and Unconsciousness

Cognitive psychology is a vast field that explores the intricacies of human thought processes. In this chapter, we delve into the complex world of consciousness and unconsciousness, examining what it means to be aware or unaware of our thoughts and experiences. The study of consciousness is challenging due to its subjective nature, making it difficult to measure and compare across individuals.

Consciousness refers to the state of being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. It encompasses a spectrum of arousal and clarity, ranging from heightened awareness to complete unconsciousness. Unconsciousness, on the other hand, involves mental activation below conscious awareness, influencing behavior without our explicit knowledge or control.

#### B. System One and System Two: The Dual-Stream Theory

The concept of two separate systems for thinking, system one and system two, is central to understanding consciousness and unconsciousness. **System one** operates automatically, relying on gut reactions and intuition. It processes information quickly and effortlessly, often without our conscious awareness. In contrast, **system two** requires effortful decisions using logic or reasoning, engaging our conscious mind.

Examples of system one thinking include:

* Processing fluency: Some stimuli are easier to process than others, making them seem more accurate or true.
* Implicit association test (IAT): People's biases are revealed through reaction times when categorizing words related to certain groups.
* Priming: Holding a warm cup of coffee can make participants perceive someone more warmly, while holding an iced coffee makes them seem less friendly.

#### C. The Cognitive Unconscious and Its Manifestations

The cognitive unconscious refers to mental activation below conscious awareness, influencing behavior without our explicit knowledge or control. This concept is closely related to system one thinking, as both involve automatic processing of information.

Manifestations of the cognitive unconscious include:

* Implicit memories: Memories that are not consciously recalled but still influence behavior.
* Reflexes: Automatic responses to stimuli, such as withdrawing a hand from a hot surface.
* Priming: The influence of previous experiences or stimuli on our current thoughts and behaviors.

#### D. Blindsight and Unconscious Perception

Blindsight is a phenomenon where individuals with brain damage in their occipital lobe can navigate without visual perception. Despite being unable to consciously perceive visual stimuli, they may still react to it unconsciously. This raises questions about subliminal or subconscious perception and the nature of consciousness.

Examples of blindsight include:

* A patient with blind sight who consistently tried to insert an envelope into a slot at almost perfect or perpendicular angles, despite being unable to consciously perceive the angle.
* Split-brain research: Individuals with their corpus callosum severed show strange occurrences in their conscious and unconscious processing.

#### E. The Default Mode Network and Consciousness

The default mode network is the brain's default processes that occur while we're not actively thinking. It may be involved in forming consciousness, as seen in studies where individuals can learn new skills without being consciously aware of them.

Examples include:

* Amnesia cases: Individuals with amnesia can learn new skills without remembering how they learned it.
* The disruption of explicit memory formation does not affect implicit memory formation.

#### F. Studying Subjective Experiences and Consciousness

Studying subjective experiences, such as qualia, is challenging due to their inherent subjectivity. Researchers have used self-reporting, neuroimaging, and other methods to try to overcome these challenges.

Examples include:

* Synesthesia tests: Can objectively measure an individual's subjective experience.
* The neuronal workspace theory: Suggests that working memory plays a crucial role in conscious awareness.
* Creativity can also occur within this workspace.
