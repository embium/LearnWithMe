### I. Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
#### A. Historical Background

Cognitive psychology emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a response to the limitations of behaviorism, which dominated the field of psychology at that time. Behaviorism, led by John Watson's ideas, focused solely on observable behaviors, dismissing emotions and thoughts as unscientific. However, many researchers grew dissatisfied with this approach due to its inability to account for internal mental processes.

#### B. The Rise of Cognitive Psychology

The development of cognitive psychology was influenced by several factors:

*   **Computational Metaphor**: The rise of computers led to the conceptualization of the human brain as a computer, processing information through input, processing, and output. This idea built upon John Stuart Mill's concept of tabula rasa, or a blank slate.
*   **Information Theory**: As technology advanced, people began to think about behavior in terms of information theory, where everything can be considered a binary response of yes or no.
*   **George Miller's "Magic Numbers"**: George Miller's work on the limited capacity for short-term memory, proposing that humans can generally remember about seven items, marked a significant shift in the field. His assertion challenged prevailing views on human cognition and led to a focus on understanding internal limitations.

#### C. Key Concepts

*   **Short-Term Memory**: The concept of a "magic number" seven plus or minus two suggests that humans have a limited capacity for short-term memory.
*   **Internal Limitations**: Cognitive psychology seeks to understand how and why we do what we do, including the mechanisms internally that allow us to behave in certain ways.
*   **The "Black Box" Problem**: The impossibility of directly observing or measuring internal mental processes became a central concern for cognitive psychologists.

#### D. Research Methods

Cognitive psychologists use various research methods to infer how the mind works, such as:

*   **Manipulating Variables and Measuring Results**: By manipulating variables and measuring results, researchers can draw conclusions about internal mechanisms.
*   **Studies like the Sternberg Search Task**: The Sternberg search task examines how quickly people can find a target item amidst distractors, allowing researchers to analyze input (number of distractors) and output (reaction time).

### II. Key Figures in Cognitive Psychology
#### A. John Watson

John Watson was a key figure in behaviorism, which dominated the field of psychology before the emergence of cognitive psychology. His ideas focused solely on observable behaviors, dismissing emotions and thoughts as unscientific.

#### B. George Miller

George Miller's work on short-term memory and the "magic numbers" marked a significant shift in the field of psychology. His assertion challenged prevailing views on human cognition and led to a focus on understanding internal limitations.

### III. Conclusion
Cognitive psychology emerged as a response to the limitations of behaviorism, focusing on understanding internal mental processes and mechanisms. The development of cognitive psychology was influenced by several factors, including the rise of computers, information theory, and George Miller's work on short-term memory. Cognitive psychologists use various research methods to infer how the mind works, such as manipulating variables and measuring results.
