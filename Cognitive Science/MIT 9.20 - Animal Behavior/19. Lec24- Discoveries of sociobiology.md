### I. Upcoming Class Schedule and Assignments
#### A. No Quiz Today, but Next Week's Quiz on Sociobiology

The class will not have a quiz today, but students should be prepared for one next week that covers discoveries in sociobiology. This topic has been discussed in class and will continue to be covered on Friday. The instructor plans to finish reviewing notes from EO Wilson's book "Sociobiology" in the next class.

#### B. Homework Assignment: Selecting Report Topics

There will also be a homework assignment where students are asked to find topics for their reports, with at least two options provided. This homework is meant to encourage students to read and understand the assignment guidelines before selecting their final topic. The instructor emphasizes the importance of reading the assignment carefully to avoid selecting an unacceptable topic.

#### C. Upcoming Quiz Date

The quiz is expected to take place next Wednesday. Students should make sure to review the material covered in class, including notes from EO Wilson's book "Sociobiology," and be prepared for the exam.

### II. Sociobiology: A Shift in Research Focus
#### A. Introduction to Sociobiology

Sociobiology has led to significant changes in animal behavior research, with a shift from proximate questions (sensory processes, hormonal changes) to ultimate questions (why certain behaviors are adaptive). This change started before the publication of EO Wilson's book "Sociobiology" and was influenced by George C Williams' work on adaptation and natural selection.

#### B. The Importance of Understanding this Shift

The instructor highlights the importance of understanding this shift in research focus, as it has significant implications for our understanding of animal behavior and evolution.

### III. Cryptic Female Choice
#### A. Introduction to Cryptic Female Choice

In many species, females have evolved cryptic ways to exert choice over their mates, often favoring males with better genes. This can be seen in behaviors such as sperm competition, where the last sperm in has a higher chance of fertilizing an egg.

#### B. Strategies for Males and Females

Males have countered this by developing strategies to increase their chances of successful fertilization, including frequent copulation and pre-copulatory pecking at the female's cloaca region, which can expel previous sperm. Some males even use traumatic insemination, where they injure the female during mating to prevent her from mating with other males.

#### C. Examples of Cryptic Female Choice

This is seen in insects such as bed bugs, which insert sperm into the female's body cavity without using the genital tract. In some cases, females have evolved specialized body parts to protect themselves from injury and reduce trauma. These strategies highlight a different kind of sexual selection, where both sexes are selecting for different traits, rather than just males competing for females' attention.

#### D. Research on Primates

Research on primates has also shown evidence of cryptic female choice, where females may be mating with multiple males but favoring certain ones over others based on their genetic fitness.

### IV. Sperm Heteromorphism and Female Choice
#### A. Introduction to Sperm Heteromorphism

The discovery of sperm heteromorphism, where two types of sperm with different functions are produced, further supports the idea that females have evolved mechanisms to exert control over their mates and choose the best genes for their offspring.

#### B. Implications of Sperm Heteromorphism

This finding has significant implications for our understanding of female choice and the evolution of reproductive strategies in animals.
