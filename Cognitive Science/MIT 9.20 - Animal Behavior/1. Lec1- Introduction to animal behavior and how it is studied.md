### I. Introduction to Animal Behavior Study
#### A. Overview of the Course

This course, 920, is designed to provide an in-depth exploration of animal behavior through various approaches, including ethology and sociobiology. By examining the evolution of ideas about animal behavior, students will gain a deeper understanding of the subject and its relevance to human society.

#### B. Key Concepts and Focus Areas

- **Ethology**: The study of animal behavior, which includes key concepts such as fixed action patterns and instinctive behavior.
- **Sociobiology**: The examination of the evolutionary significance of behaviors, which emerged in the 1970s but was met with resistance and controversy due to ideological differences.

### II. Ethological Principles
#### A. Fixed Action Patterns

Fixed action patterns refer to a set of innate behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli and are characteristic of certain species. These patterns are inherited and universal across all members of a species, regardless of environmental or cultural factors. Examples include:

- **Migration**: Many bird species exhibit fixed action patterns related to migration, where they follow the same routes and schedules each year.
- **Courtship Behaviors**: Some animals display specific courtship behaviors that are innate and universal among their species.

#### B. Instinctive Behavior

Instinctive behavior refers to actions that are inherited and occur without prior learning or experience. These patterns have been observed in various animal species, including humans. Examples include:

- **Emotional Expressions**: Human emotional expressions, such as smiling or frowning, are considered instinctive behaviors.
- **Maternal Instincts**: Many female mammals exhibit innate maternal instincts, caring for their young without prior learning.

### III. Sociobiological Perspectives
#### A. Evolutionary Significance of Behaviors

Sociobiology examines the evolutionary significance of behaviors and how they contribute to an individual's survival and reproductive success. This field has provided insights into human social behavior, including:

- **Altruism**: The willingness to sacrifice one's own interests for the benefit of others.
- **Cooperation**: The ability to work together towards a common goal.

#### B. Research Methods in Sociobiology

Sociobiologists use various research methods to study animal behavior, including:

- **Behavioral Tests**: Controlled experiments designed to measure specific behaviors.
- **Observations**: Systematic observations of animals in their natural habitats or controlled environments.

### IV. History and Development of Animal Behavior Study
#### A. Medieval Bestiaries

Medieval bestiaries were collections of stories about real and mythical creatures, which laid the groundwork for later studies on animal behavior. These early texts often included descriptions of animal characteristics and behaviors.

#### B. Contributions of Amateur Naturalists and Scientists

Notable contributors to the study of animal behavior include:

- **Charles Darwin**: His observations on animal behavior, particularly in relation to instinctive patterns, have had a lasting impact on the field.
- **Conrad Lawrence**: A pioneer in ethology, Lawrence's work focused on the study of animal behavior and its application to human society.

### V. Integration of Ethology and Sociobiology
#### A. Recent Studies

Recent studies have successfully integrated ethology and sociobiology into their research, providing a more comprehensive understanding of animal behavior. This integration has led to new insights into behavioral patterns that are not typically found in other behavioral sciences.

#### B. The Study of Mology

The study of mology focuses on specific aspects of animal biology, such as habitat and species characteristics. This field offers additional insights into behavioral patterns that are not typically found in ethology or sociobiology.
