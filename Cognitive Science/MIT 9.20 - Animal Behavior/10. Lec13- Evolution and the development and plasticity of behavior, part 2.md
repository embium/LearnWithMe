### I. Autonomic Nervous System and Orienting Mechanisms
#### A. Conflict Between Expected and Actual Stimuli

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a crucial role in responding to conflict between expected and actual stimuli. This conflict can arise due to differences in internal representations of what is known to be true versus cognitive systems that generate them. For instance, memories and expectancies are closely tied with motivational systems, allowing for two different systems to be active at the same time and generate autonomic responses when in conflict.

**Key Term:** Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

The ANS consists of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which work together to regulate various bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. When an individual experiences a conflict between expected and actual stimuli, their ANS responds by activating the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.

Some individuals may have isolated systems that do not cause actual conflict, while others can learn to suppress autonomic responses, although this is exceedingly difficult. This suppression can be achieved through various techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or cognitive-behavioral therapy.

#### B. Classical Conditioning

Classical conditioning involves a response to an unconditioned stimulus (US) leading to an unconditional response (UCR), which can then be conditioned by associating it with a neutral stimulus (CS). The CS becomes a predictor of the US and eventually elicits the same UCR.

**Key Term:** Unconditioned Stimulus (US)

An example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov's experiment on dogs, where he rang a bell (neutral stimulus) before presenting food (unconditioned stimulus), leading to salivation (unconditional response). Over time, the dogs learned to associate the bell with the food and eventually salivated when they heard the bell alone.

Classical conditioning has been studied in various animals, including sea slugs, snails, fruit flies, and others, due to their simpler nervous systems and predictable learning situations. This type of conditioning is essential for understanding how animals learn and respond to stimuli.

#### C. Social Learning

Social learning involves imitation or mimicry, with birds learning songs by mimicking adults and young cats imitating their mother's hunting behavior. However, there is a difference between imitation and mimicry, with the former involving immediate reward and the latter not.

**Key Term:** Imitation vs. Mimicry

Imitation involves immediately copying a behavior or action, whereas mimicry involves learning and adapting to a behavior without immediate reward. This distinction has been observed in various non-human primates and other animals.

Examples of social learning include:

* Birds learning songs by mimicking adults
* Young cats imitating their mother's hunting behavior
* Non-human primates learning complex behaviors through observation and imitation

#### D. Navigation

Navigation involves using landmarks to find one's way, as demonstrated by studies on wasps that use specific features of their environment to locate their nests. These wasps can remember multiple nest locations and adapt to changes in their surroundings.

**Key Term:** Path Integration

Some animals, like desert ants, use path integration to navigate without landmarks. This involves tracking the number of steps taken and the length of each stride to determine direction. Other animals, such as homing pigeons, have a compass and map that allows them to navigate back to their loft, even from long distances.

Examples of navigation include:

* Wasps using specific features of their environment to locate their nests
* Desert ants using path integration to navigate without landmarks
* Homing pigeons using a compass and map to find their way back to their loft

#### E. Fixed Action Patterns

Fixed action patterns, like navigation, can be maladaptive if they conflict with environmental changes. For example, photo pollution affecting sea turtle hatchlings' ability to reach the sea.

**Key Term:** Maladaptive Behavior

Maladaptive behavior refers to a fixed action pattern that is no longer beneficial or effective due to changes in the environment. Understanding these innate behaviors and adapting to them can be crucial for conservation efforts.

Examples of fixed action patterns include:

* Sea turtle hatchlings' ability to reach the sea
* Desert ants using path integration to navigate without landmarks
* Homing pigeons using a compass and map to find their way back to their loft

#### F. Conservation Efforts

By understanding these innate behaviors and adapting to them, conservation efforts have successfully increased the survival rate of various species. For example, using alternative colors and flashing lights that do not attract sea turtle hatchlings has helped increase their survival rate.

**Key Term:** Conservation Efforts

Conservation efforts involve implementing strategies to protect and preserve endangered or threatened species. Understanding innate behaviors and adapting to them can be crucial for the success of these efforts.

Examples of conservation efforts include:

* Using alternative colors and flashing lights that do not attract sea turtle hatchlings
* Implementing navigation systems to help animals find their way back to their habitats
* Providing education and awareness about the importance of preserving natural habitats
