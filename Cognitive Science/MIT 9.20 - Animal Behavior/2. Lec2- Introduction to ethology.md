### I. Fixed Action Patterns in Sticklebacks
#### A. Introduction to Fixed Action Patterns

Fixed action patterns are innate behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli and lead to a predictable outcome. In the context of stickleback fish, one such pattern is the male's behavior of leading a female to his nest after being chosen from a group. This behavior is an excellent example of how fixed action patterns can be adaptive in certain situations.

#### B. The Role of Visual Cues

The sight of the male stickleback's actions triggers this fixed action pattern, indicating that visual cues play a crucial role in initiating this behavior. This is not surprising, given that many animals rely heavily on visual information to navigate their environment and interact with others.

#### C. Adaptive Significance of Fixed Action Patterns

The purpose of this fixed action pattern is adaptive because larger females have more eggs, allowing the male to inseminate them and increase offspring numbers. This highlights the importance of understanding the context in which a behavior occurs, as it can provide valuable insights into its adaptive significance.

### II. The Influence of Early Experience on Later Responses
#### A. Introduction to the Role of Early Experience

Early experience plays a significant role in shaping later responses in fish, including anti-predator behavior and escape patterns. This is an important area of study, as it can provide valuable insights into how animals learn and adapt to their environment.

#### B. Examples of Early Experience Shaping Later Responses

*   Anti-predator behavior: Fish that have experienced predation early in life may develop more effective anti-predator strategies later on.
*   Escape patterns: Fish that have learned to escape from predators early in life may be better equipped to do so later on.

### III. Evolution of Sticklebacks and Cannibalism
#### A. Introduction to the Evolution of Sticklebacks

The evolution of sticklebacks is an interesting area of study, particularly when it comes to their behavior. One such example is the development of cannibalistic behavior in some populations of sticklebacks.

#### B. The Role of Cannibalism in Stickleback Evolution

Cannibalism involves both males and females, with the female benefiting from eating eggs not her own but the male wanting to preserve his inseminated eggs until they hatch. This behavior is an example of how evolution can lead to complex and sometimes surprising outcomes.

#### C. Tinbergen's Studies on Birds
The film will continue next time with a discussion of Tinbergen's studies on birds, including kittiwake gulls. These studies provide valuable insights into the evolution of bird behavior and are an important area of study in their own right.
