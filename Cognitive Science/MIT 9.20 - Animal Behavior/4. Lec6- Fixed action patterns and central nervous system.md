### I. Upcoming Class Schedule
#### A. Important Dates and Events

- The class will continue on Wednesday with a quiz.
- Despite being a student holiday, it's recommended to attend the career fair on Friday.

### II. Ethology of Geese
#### A. Mobbing Reaction in Geese

- Geese exhibit a mobbing reaction when confronted with a bird-like silhouette.
- This response may not be an innate behavior, as the precise shape they're responding to is likely learned through experience.
- The distinction highlights the complexity of instinctive behaviors and the importance of considering both innate and learned components in understanding animal behavior.

#### B. Supernormal Stimuli

- Certain stimuli can elicit a stronger response than their natural counterparts.
- Examples include:
  - The conspicuous red-orange spot on heron chicks that triggers a gaping response.
  - Exaggerated features used in advertising to attract attention.
- Similar principles apply in humans, such as the instinctive preference for sweeter and fatter foods.

### III. Nervous System
#### A. Primary Sensory Neurons

- These neurons transmit information from sensory receptors to the central nervous system.
- They play a crucial role in facilitating behavior and are essential for understanding animal responses.

#### B. Secondary Sensory Neurons, Motor Neurons, and Interneurons

- Secondary sensory neurons process and refine sensory information before transmitting it to the central nervous system.
- Motor neurons transmit signals from the central nervous system to muscles or glands, enabling movement and response.
- Interneurons integrate and process information within the central nervous system, facilitating complex behaviors.

#### C. Examples of Specialized Sensory Systems

- A wandering spider's ability to catch insects without a web illustrates how specialized sensory systems can be used for hunting.
- The visual system of frogs and toads was discussed in relation to their prey-catching abilities.

### IV. Brain Structures Controlling Fixed Action Patterns
#### A. Midbrain's Map of the Retina

- The midbrain's map of the retina is conserved across vertebrates, with relative size changes but not structural differences.
- This conservation extends to other brain structures controlling fixed action patterns.

#### B. Command Neurons and Motor Neurons

- Command neurons are a specific type of neuron that, when stimulated, trigger a whole pattern of movement, often a behavior.
- These neurons are typically found in invertebrates, where they can be identified across species.
- In vertebrates, groups of neurons act similarly to command neurons, eliciting sequences of movements.

#### C. Giant Axon and Saltatory Conduction

- The giant axon, found in squid and other cephalopods, is a large-diameter axon that enables rapid conduction of the action potential.
- This insulation allows for saltatory conduction, where the action potential jumps from node to node, enabling fast transmission without requiring an excessively large axon.
