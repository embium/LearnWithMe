### I. Introduction to Animal Movement and Behavior
#### A. Overview of Course Topics

The course will delve into the fascinating world of genetics and learning, with a special focus on navigation and migration in animals. We will explore the diverse range of movement abilities found in single-cell organisms and multicellular animals, from locomotive activity and orienting movements to grasping and special purpose movements. This comprehensive approach will provide a solid foundation for understanding the complex behaviors exhibited by various species.

#### B. Early Development of Movement Abilities

In vertebrates, even before the development of the forebrain, basic movement abilities are represented in the midbrain. The midbrain controls locomotion, orienting movements, and grasping movements, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated behaviors to emerge later. This early foundation is crucial for understanding how animals navigate their environment and interact with their surroundings.

#### C. Motivational States Behind Movement

The motivational states behind these movements involve the forebrain, which will be discussed further in the course. Understanding the drives and motivational systems that regulate behavior is essential for grasping the complexities of animal movement and behavior.

### II. Stability in Behavior
#### A. Introduction to Behavioral Stability

Stability in behavior refers to the maintenance of internal homeostasis, balance, and temporal organization. This concept encompasses three types of stability:

*   **Internal Environment Stability**: The ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes.
*   **Spatial Stability**: The capacity to maintain balance and orientation in space.
*   **Temporal Stability**: The ability to organize behavior over time.

These stabilities are crucial for ensuring that animals can adapt to their environment, navigate their surroundings, and respond appropriately to changing circumstances.

#### B. Regulators of Behavior

The regulators of behavior, including drives and motivational systems, play a vital role in shaping animal movement and behavior. We will explore the following:

*   **Ingestion Drives**: The motivations behind eating and drinking behaviors.
*   **Defensive Behaviors**: The responses to threats or danger.
*   **Social Motivations**: The drives that govern social interactions and relationships.
*   **Reproductive Drives**: The motivations behind mating and reproduction.

### III. Genetics and Behavior
#### A. Introduction to Genetic Influence on Behavior

The relationship between genes and behavior is a complex one, with genetic fitness and inclusive fitness playing a crucial role in understanding behavioral evolution. We will examine how genetic differences can influence behavior, using the example of honeybees and their hygienic behavior.

#### B. Habituation and Sensory Adaptation

Habituation and sensory adaptation refer to the decreased responses to repeated stimuli. This process is essential for animals to adapt to their environment and respond appropriately to changing circumstances.

### IV. Learning and Behavior
#### A. Introduction to Learning and Conditioning

The course will conclude by discussing learning and its various forms, including associative learning and conditioning. We will explore how animals learn from experience and adapt to new situations.

#### B. Responses to Novelty

We will examine the responses to novelty, such as arousal response, orienting response, curiosity, and exploratory behavior. The motivation to seek novelty, particularly in higher vertebrates, will also be discussed, highlighting the importance of cognitive psychology in understanding behavioral responses to conflict and novelty.

This comprehensive approach will provide a solid foundation for understanding the complex behaviors exhibited by various species, from single-cell organisms to multicellular animals.
