### I. Introduction to Syntax Review
#### A. Brief Overview of the Syllabus Review

As we continue with syntax, it's essential to review the syllabus to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The review will likely be completed by Thursday, so bear with it for another week.

#### B. Exploring Language Variations and Syntax Choices

The world has many languages, but not as many combinations as one might imagine. Languages make choices regarding how they do certain things syntactically, but we don't find all logically possible combinations. For instance, some languages move their wh-phrases to the left periphery of the clause, while others leave them where they are.

### II. Embedded Clauses and Diagramming
#### A. Understanding Embedded Clauses

Embedded clauses are a crucial aspect of syntax, allowing us to express complex ideas within a sentence. Let's take a class exercise and diagram the embedded clause in "I thought that Mary ate sushi with chopsticks." We'll start by labeling everything, identifying what type of word each element is, and then merge nodes to create a tree structure.

#### B. Merging Nodes and Creating a Tree Structure

As we work through this example, it's essential to understand how languages make choices regarding how they build their syntax. Specifically, let's focus on the order of heads in embedded clauses. The phenomenon of verb-second (V2) word order is a common feature in many languages, including German.

### III. Verb-Second (V2) Word Order
#### A. Understanding V2 and Its Exceptions

The V2 phenomenon occurs when the auxiliary verb precedes the main clause. However, not all embedded clauses exhibit V2, as long as they don't start with "Das" or another complementizer. This exception allows for embedded V2 structures, such as "Mary wanted to eat sushi with chopsticks," where the phrase "with chopsticks" can be moved into the specifier of CP.

#### B. German's Tree Structure and Complementizers

German's tree structure has a complementizer preceding its complement, making everything head-final in the verbal part of the clause. When no complementizer is pronounced, two movements occur: some phrase moves into the specifier of CP, and the auxiliary or verb moves into C, resulting in the pattern seen in V2 languages.

### IV. Movement Restrictions and Constraints
#### A. The "That Trace Effect" and Subject Islands

The concept of movement in language is complex, and there are certain restrictions on what can be moved. One such restriction is the "that Trace effect," which states that a wh phrase cannot move past a that phrase to its left. This means that if you ask someone how many animals of each kind did Moses take on the ark, they may respond as if you asked about Noah, despite knowing that Moses didn't take any animals on the ark.

#### B. Head Movement Constraint and Shortest Move Principle

Another restriction is the head movement constraint, which states that when moving a head into C (the complementizer position), the higher head should be moved, not the lower one. This can be illustrated with the sentence "Will Mary type novels?" where moving the auxiliary verb into C results in an ungrammatical sentence. The shortest move principle attempts to unify these restrictions by stating that movement should choose the shorter path.

### V. Conclusion and Future Directions
#### A. Recap of Key Concepts

In conclusion, this review has covered essential aspects of syntax, including embedded clauses, V2 word order, and movement restrictions. It's crucial to understand how languages make choices regarding how they build their syntax and the complex interactions between different components.

#### B. Future Research and Debates

The shortest move principle is still being developed and refined, and there are ongoing debates about its exact formulation. As we continue to explore the intricacies of language, it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field of syntax.
