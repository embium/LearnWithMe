### I. Introduction to Syntax and Linguistics
#### A. Overview of the Study of Language

As we continue our exploration of languages, we're reminded that syntax is not yet complete. In fact, there's still much to be discussed in this area. To help you keep track of our progress, a syllabus update will be provided soon.

The study of linguistics aims to understand what makes human minds work the way they do when it comes to constructing language. This includes the rules used to make sense of limited data and how languages vary. By exploring these ideas, we can gain insights into the nature of language itself.

#### B. The Importance of Understanding Human Minds in Language Study

Understanding human minds is crucial in linguistics as it helps us comprehend why languages behave in certain ways. This understanding relies on making conclusions based on limited data, a concept known as induction. Induction is similar to mathematical functions where one can't predict the output for an input not yet seen.

For instance, in science, one might hypothesize that every crow will be black based on repeated observations of crows being black. However, this assumption may not hold true if a black crow is never observed. Similarly, children learning Bulgarian or Chinese tend to assume that wh-questions move all their phrases together, rather than considering alternative grammatical structures.

This suggests that the human mind has an innate preference for certain linguistic patterns, which may be related to universal principles governing language acquisition.

### II. Language Variation and Imagination
#### A. Exploring Areas Where Languages Vary

As we study linguistics, we're trying to understand what makes human minds work this way, including the rules they use to make sense of limited data. We'll continue exploring these ideas by looking at areas where languages vary and imagining kinds of languages that don't exist.

This will help us better understand why languages behave in certain ways, which is a central occupation of linguistics. By understanding what human minds are like, we can gain insights into the nature of language itself.

#### B. Hypotheses About Human Minds and Language Construction

The concept of induction underlies scientific inquiry, relying on making conclusions based on limited data. This is analogous to mathematical functions where one can't predict the output for an input not yet seen.

For example, in science, one might hypothesize that every crow will be black based on repeated observations of crows being black. However, this assumption may not hold true if a black crow is never observed.

Similarly, children learning Bulgarian or Chinese tend to assume that wh-questions move all their phrases together, rather than considering alternative grammatical structures. This suggests that the human mind has an innate preference for certain linguistic patterns, which may be related to universal principles governing language acquisition.

### III. The Extended Projection Principle and Idioms
#### A. Understanding the Extended Projection Principle

The extended projection principle in linguistics proposes that every sentence must have a subject, even if it's not explicitly mentioned. This requirement can lead to the insertion of meaningless phrases, known as expletives, to satisfy the principle.

This concept highlights the complexities of human language and the need for further research into its underlying mechanisms.

#### B. The Nature of Idioms

Idioms are often misunderstood, with some people thinking they can consist of a subject and verb where the object can be anything. However, this is not the case, as idioms typically involve a fixed combination of words that have both literal and figurative meanings.

For example, "kick the bucket" means die, but also has a literal meaning of kicking a bucket. Idioms often consist of a verb and an object or phrase, such as "buy the farm," where the subject can be anything, but the idiom itself is not just the subject and verb.

#### C. The Role of the Extended Projection Principle in Understanding Idioms

The behavior of idioms provides insight into the nature of language and the forces that shape it, including the extended projection principle (EPP) and other grammatical principles.

The EPP demands that there be something in subject position, which can lead to movement of the subject into the specifier of TP. This is supported by the VP internal subject hypothesis, which suggests that subjects start lower than T and raise into the specifier of TP.

Overall, the behavior of idioms offers a unique perspective on language and its underlying mechanisms, shedding light on the complexities of human communication.
