### I. Sentence Construction and Pronouns
#### A. Understanding Pronoun Reference

- **Pronoun reference** is a crucial aspect of sentence construction, as it determines how pronouns relate to the rest of the sentence.
- In the example "she would recognize Mary," the pronoun "she" cannot refer to Mary because she appears later in the sentence.
- This contrast highlights the importance of understanding how pronouns interact with other elements in a sentence.

#### B. The Principle of Alpha

- A key principle in linguistics states that if a noun phrase merges with another node (Alpha), it cannot refer to any names dominated by Alpha.
- This principle helps explain why "she" cannot refer to Mary in the example given, as they are part of different nodes in the sentence structure.

#### C. C-command and Its Significance

- **C-command** is a relationship that holds between a node like "she" and another node like "Mary" in this kind of tree.
- This relation will be crucial as we delve deeper into syntax, helping us understand how pronouns interact with other elements in a sentence.

### II. Verb Selection and Phrase Combination
#### A. Understanding Verb Selection

- Verbs like "put" require an object and a prepositional phrase to function correctly, making them transitive in nature.
- This means they need a specific type of phrase to accompany them, such as "the anteater put the ants onto a plate."
- Verbs like "depend" select for a prepositional phrase with a particular head, such as "on," while verbs like "think" select for a clause with a particular word as its head, such as "that."

#### B. The Concept of Selection

- **Selection** is the concept that verbs combine with specific types of phrases to form sentences.
- This understanding is crucial in grasping how verbs and other words interact to create meaningful sentences.

#### C. Examples of Verb Selection

- For example, "I will tickle the child" requires an object, while "I will depend on the child" requires a prepositional phrase.
- However, "with a feather" can be added to any sentence without changing its grammaticality, making it an adjunct rather than an argument.

### III. Arguments and Adjuncts in English Sentences
#### A. Understanding Arguments and Adjuncts

- An **argument** is a word or phrase that must be present to form a complete sentence.
- On the other hand, an **adjunct** is a word or phrase that can be added but doesn't change the basic meaning of the sentence.

#### B. The Distinction Between Arguments and Adjuncts

- This distinction is crucial for understanding how words combine to form sentences and what types of phrases are required for certain verbs to function correctly.
- For example, "I tickled the child with a feather" implies using the feather as an instrument, whereas "I had lunch with a child" introduces someone who shares the activity with me.

#### C. The Role of Prepositional Phrases

- **Prepositional phrases** can have subtly different meanings depending on their placement in the sentence.
- For instance, "I decided on the boat" can make "on the boat" either an argument or an adjunct, depending on its proximity to the verb.

#### D. The Theory of English Sentences and Argument Satisfaction

- According to this theory, arguments should be satisfied first, followed by adjuncts.
- This principle helps explain why some prepositional phrases are more likely to be arguments than others.
