### I. English Plurals: Formation and Pronunciation
#### A. Overview of English Plural Formation

English plurals are formed by adding the suffix "-s" to the singular form, but there are exceptions such as "children" and "oxen". The plural suffix can be pronounced in three different ways: as a z sound (dogs), an S sound (cats), or a schwa followed by a z sound (brushes). Understanding these variations is crucial for analyzing phonological problems in English.

#### B. Stridents and the Plural Suffix

The variation in plural pronunciation is due to the presence of stridents, which are a class of fricatives that produce high-frequency noise and include sounds like S and Z. When a strident precedes the plural suffix, it triggers the insertion of a schwa, resulting in a schwazi sound. This rule can be applied universally, making it a general property of English phonology rather than a specific characteristic of the plural morpheme.

#### C. Pronunciation Rules for Plural Suffix

If there's no strident preceding the suffix, the sound before it determines whether to use an S or a Z pronunciation. For example:

* When preceded by a voiceless consonant (e.g., /k/, /t/), the plural suffix is pronounced as /s/.
* When preceded by a voiced consonant (e.g., /b/, /v/), the plural suffix is pronounced as /z/.

#### D. Implications for Phonological Analysis

When analyzing phonological problems, it's essential to consider both the specific sound changes occurring and why they're happening. In English, this might involve inserting schwas or devoicing consonants, among other things.

### II. General Principles in Phonology
#### A. Introduction to General Principles

Languages like Yellow Money have general patterns that govern their phonology, such as avoiding sequences of three consonants in a row. By examining how different morphemes interact with each other, we can identify these underlying principles and understand why certain sound changes occur.

#### B. Examples from Other Languages

* In Japanese, words have at most one accent and various mechanisms are employed to avoid having more than one accent in a single word.
* In Yellow Money, the suffix "Tau" is added to verbs to form gerunds, but this process involves inserting a vowel between two consonants if they would otherwise create an unacceptable sequence of three consonants in a row.

#### C. Prioritization Systems

Some languages have a ranked list of priorities, where certain principles take precedence over others. For example:

* Japanese has a high priority on not having more than one accent in a word and achieves this through various means such as getting rid of the first or second accent depending on the circumstances.
* Japanese also prioritizes keeping the accent on certain words like "good eye" and nouns.

#### D. Implications for Understanding Phonological Systems

By recognizing these general patterns and the ways in which languages repair violations of them, we can gain a deeper understanding of phonological systems and their complexities.
