### I. Semantics Overview
#### A. Introduction to Ambiguity in Sentences

The discussion on semantics began with a review of previous day's topic, focusing on the ambiguity of sentences like "two guards seem to be standing in front of every building." This sentence can have two readings: one where there are two large guards standing in front of each building, and another where there are two smaller guards who believe they are standing in front of each building. The ambiguity arises from the fact that "every building" can undergo quantifier raising (QR), which gets it past "two guards," but this operation has restrictions on how far it can go.

#### B. Quantifier Raising and Its Restrictions

Quantifier raising is a process that allows a phrase to move out of its original position, affecting the scope of other elements in the sentence. In the case of "every building," QR gets it past "two guards," but this operation has restrictions on how far it can go. This limitation leads to ambiguity in sentences like the one mentioned earlier.

#### C. Embedded Infinitival Clauses and Quantifier Raising

A new example, "two guards think that I am standing in front of every building," was introduced to illustrate a case where QR cannot get out of the embedded infinitival clause. This led to a discussion about the scope of QR and how it interacts with other linguistic phenomena, such as anaphor binding and reconstruction.

### II. Reconstruction in Syntax
#### A. Definition and Implications

Reconstruction involves picking a particular position to interpret a moved phrase in both for binding theory and for quantifier scope. It's not just about looking back at the past positions of a moved element but rather about collapsing the waveform of possible positions into a single interpretation.

#### B. Reconstruction and Quantifier Scope

The concept of reconstruction was revisited, and it was noted that it involves interpreting a moved phrase in multiple positions within the tree structure. This process affects quantifier scope, which determines the extent to which a quantifier applies to a sentence.

### III. Copy Theory of Movement
#### A. Definition and Implications

The copy theory of movement posits that movement involves merging an element with itself in multiple places within the tree structure. This theory was seen as a way to handle the data on reconstruction and to explain why certain languages pronounce the higher or lower copy of a moved element differently.

### IV. Phonology and Semantics
#### A. Smeared Properties

The discussion touched on the idea that properties like front or back for vowels in Finnish are smeared across the whole word, rather than being specified for each individual vowel. This was compared to the concept of reconstruction in syntax, where elements can be in multiple places at once due to repeated merging within the tree structure.

#### B. Ellipsis and Its Variations

Ellipsis is a property of sentences where parts can be left out. English has VP Ellipsis, which is relatively rare compared to other languages. In English, if you're about to repeat a verb phrase, you have the option of leaving it out, as in "Adam ate an apple and Eve did too." This is different from sluicing, where most of a question can be left out, such as "Adam ate something but I don't know what" or "I don't know what Adam ate."

### V. Focus in Linguistics
#### A. Definition and Implications

The concept of Focus in linguistics refers to the phenomenon where a speaker emphasizes certain words or phrases to convey meaning. When we say "I will give Mary three cookies," the emphasis on "three" implies that only three cookies are being given, not four or five.

#### B. Focus Projection and Its Rules

Focus projection is the process by which the emphasis on a word or phrase invites us to consider alternatives to that word or phrase. In some cases, the emphasis can even imply that certain alternatives are false. The rules for Focus projection are complex and still being studied by linguists.

#### C. Variations Across Languages

Some languages, like English, use intonation to convey emphasis, while others, such as Spanish and Tagalog, may require different word orders or morphemes to achieve the same effect.
