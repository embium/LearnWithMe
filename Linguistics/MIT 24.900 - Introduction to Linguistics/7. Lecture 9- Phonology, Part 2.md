### I. Accent Placement in Japanese Compounds
#### A. Overview of Rules Governing Accent Placement

Japanese compounds with two parts always have one accent on a particular syllable. The rules governing accent placement in these compounds state that there should only be one accent, which must be next to the boundary between the words, and ideally on the second word. However, if this would result in the accent being final, it's not done.

#### B. Exceptions to the Rule

A general pattern emerges for most examples of Japanese compounds, such as "French fries," where the accent is at the beginning of the second half of the compound. However, there are exceptions when the second half of the compound has only one syllable, like in "Kagawa prefecture." In this case, the accent is placed at the end of the first word instead.

#### C. Conflict Between Goals

The rules governing accent placement in Japanese compounds illustrate a series of conflicting goals that can be fruitfully thought of as a series of things to do that are in conflict with each other sometimes. Japanese wants the accent to be on the second word and next to the boundary between words, but it also wants it not to be final. When these goals cannot be met simultaneously, like in "Kagawa prefecture," Japanese decides which one is more important and adjusts accordingly.

#### D. Representing Conflicting Goals with Tableau

This process of deciding among conflicting goals is similar to how robots in Isaac Asimov's stories operate, following laws that sometimes conflict with each other. The rule for Japanese accent placement can be represented using a "tableau," a formal way to think about how conditions are satisfied when they are not compatible with each other.

### II. Optimality Theory and Phonology
#### A. Introduction to Optimality Theory

Optimality Theory is an approach to phonology that aims to capture the generalization that all these rules are trying to achieve the same thing. By considering the constraints and their relative importance, we can understand why certain phenomena occur in languages like Japanese or Polish.

#### B. Understanding Phonological Constraints

Phonology involves understanding how sounds change within a language. Researchers have found that children universally know phonotactics, which are rules governing what sounds can appear together in English words. However, when it comes to sound changes, kids often make intriguing mistakes, such as incorrectly repairing words with stridents (fricatives) at the end.

#### C. Distinguishing Between Phonotactics and Sound Changes

These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between phonotactics and sound changes in language acquisition. In fact, research has shown that children's mistakes often reflect a deeper understanding of phonological principles than previously thought. By examining these errors, linguists can gain insights into how languages work and why certain sound changes are natural while others are not.

### III. Approaches to Phonological Constraints
#### A. Simulating Rules with Multiple Tableaus

One approach is to simulate having rules in order by using multiple tableaus with different conditions, effectively ranking rules with respect to each other. However, this method can be complex and may not fully capture the nuances of language.

#### B. Converting Tableaus into Ordered Rules

Another way to address the tension between conflicting goals is to use a rule that converts tableaus into ordered rules, allowing for a more straightforward approach to phonological analysis. This idea has been explored in the context of Arabic, where the definite article undergoes a sound change when followed by certain consonants, specifically coronals.

#### C. Total Assimilation and Its Implications

This type of rule is called total assimilation, and it's a common phenomenon in languages where one sound becomes more like another sound to make pronunciation easier for both the speaker and the hearer.
