### I. Morphemes: The Building Blocks of Language
#### A. Introduction to Morphemes

Morphemes are the smallest units of language that carry meaning. They are the basic elements of a language, and understanding how they combine is crucial for analyzing language structure. A mental list of basic elements of one's native language consists of a collection of morphemes, which can be free or bound.

#### B. Types of Morphemes

There are two main types of morphemes: **free morphemes** and **bound morphemes**.

*   Free morphemes, like "cat," are standalone words that can stand alone as a word.
*   Bound morphemes, such as the suffix "-s" in "cats," require combination with another morpheme to form a word. They cannot be used independently.

#### C. Properties of Morphemes

Each morpheme has information about its sound, meaning, and whether it's free or bound. Some morphemes also specify what kind of morpheme they can attach to and what result is created. For example:

*   The suffix "-al" attaches to nouns like "industry" and creates an adjective.
*   The prefix "re-" attaches to verbs like "write" and creates a new verb with a different meaning.

#### D. Morpheme Combination

The order in which morphemes are combined can affect the resulting word's meaning and grammatical category. In some cases, morphemes have multiple forms, known as **allomorphs**, which depend on their combination with other morphemes.

#### E. Examples of Morpheme Combination

*   The concept of "un" as an affix can be complex, but it generally means to reverse or undo the effect of a verb. For example, "unwrap" takes something that is wrapped and causes it to not be wrapped anymore.
*   However, not all verbs can be reversed in this way, such as "sink," which cannot be unsunk.

#### F. Allomorphs

Allomorphs are variant forms of a single morpheme. They can change depending on their context, such as the plural suffix "e" in Polish words like "język" (language) and "płyn" (juice). The rules governing allomorphs can be complex, but they often involve conditioning by the sound that precedes them.

#### G. Sound Change Rules

The issue of K's becoming G's in Polish words has been discussed, revealing that the problem cannot be predicted based on the singular form. When considering the plural form first, it becomes apparent that some nouns end in K and others in G, with a general rule applying: if a word ends in G, it becomes K in the plural.

#### H. Conclusion

Understanding morphemes and how they combine is essential for grasping language structure and analyzing linguistic phenomena like sound change and phonology. The concept of allomorphs and sound change rules can be complex, but by positing underlying forms and applying these rules, we can account for the plural forms of words without needing to list all possible sound changes.
