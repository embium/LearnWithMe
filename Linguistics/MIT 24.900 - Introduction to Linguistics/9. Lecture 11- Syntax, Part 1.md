### I. Understanding Morphological Structure in Language
#### A. The Importance of Suffixes in Word Formation

The concept of "unlockable" illustrates the importance of understanding morphological structure in language. A word like "unlockable" can be ambiguous, meaning either that it's possible to unlock something or that it cannot be locked. This ambiguity arises from the presence of two different suffixes: one that combines with verbs and makes adjectives (e.g., "singable"), and another that changes verbs into verbs (e.g., "untie"). The order in which these morphemes are combined affects the meaning of the word, as seen in the example of a door being "unlockable" when it can be unlocked but not locked. This highlights the need to consider the sequence of operations when analyzing linguistic structures.

#### B. Open-Class and Closed-Class Morphemes

The distinction between open-class and closed-class morphemes is also crucial in understanding morphological structure. Open-class morphemes, such as adjectives or nouns, can be combined with other words to form new expressions, even if their meanings are not clear. In contrast, closed-class morphemes, like prepositions or conjunctions, have more restricted uses and cannot be freely combined with other words.

### II. The Importance of Syntax in Language
#### A. Sentence Structure and Grammaticality

The example of "John walked up the stairs" and "Mary looked up the reference" demonstrates that the order in which words are combined affects their grammaticality. The first sentence is acceptable, while the second is not, despite both being composed of similar parts (a noun, verb, preposition, determiner, and noun). This distinction cannot be solely based on the familiarity or memorization of sentences, as suggested by some hypotheses in the literature.

#### B. Syntax vs. Semantics

The discussion also touches on the distinction between syntax and semantics. Syntax deals with the structure of sentences, while semantics focuses on their meaning. The distinction between these two areas is crucial in understanding how languages work. For instance, a sentence like "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" may be ungrammatical but still convey a clear meaning, whereas another sentence like "I put it on" might be grammatical but lack a clear meaning.

### III. The Study of Syntax
#### A. Competence vs. Performance

In studying syntax, we aim to develop a theory that explains how English speakers construct sentences, taking into account the complexities of real-world speech. This involves abstracting away from distractions like flies or sudden heart attacks, which can disrupt the flow of conversation. By doing so, we can create a more simplified and coherent picture of language structure.

#### B. The Concept of Units in Syntax

The concept of a unit, such as "the red book," is crucial for understanding various linguistic phenomena. When discussing topicalization, where a chunk of the sentence is moved to the beginning for emphasis, it's essential to recognize that "the red book" is a unit that can be manipulated in this way. However, there is no single unit created by combining "find" and "the red book," but rather multiple units with different properties.

#### C. Identifying Units and Their Properties

In syntax, we need to develop labels for these units, such as "noun" or "verb," which are determined by the presence of specific parts of speech within them. For example, when combining "find" with "the red book," the resulting unit has a verb-like property, whereas when combining "find" with "book in the garage," the resulting unit has a prepositional phrase structure.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. The Importance of Understanding Morphological Structure and Syntax

Ultimately, understanding the structure of language requires considering both the individual parts (morphemes) and how they are combined in specific orders to form meaningful expressions. This involves analyzing the relationships between different linguistic components and recognizing that grammaticality is not solely determined by meaning or familiarity.

#### B. The Distinction Between Prescriptive and Descriptive Studies of Grammar

The distinction between prescriptive and descriptive studies of grammar is also relevant here, with prescriptive approaches focusing on how language should be used and descriptive ones examining how it actually is used. In studying syntax, we aim to develop a theory that explains how English speakers construct sentences, taking into account the complexities of real-world speech.

#### C. The Concept of Competence vs. Performance

The concept of competence versus performance is also crucial in this context, with competence referring to what speakers would do if there were no distractions, and performance being the actual speech that people produce. By understanding the syntax of language, we can gain insights into how speakers construct meaning and communicate effectively.
