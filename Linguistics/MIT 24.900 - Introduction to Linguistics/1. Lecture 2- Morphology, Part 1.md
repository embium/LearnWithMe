### I. Introduction to Field Work and Language Data Collection
#### A. Overview of the Assignment

In this class, you will be working with a field worker who speaks a language you don't know. Your task is to collect data on this language by asking your field worker questions and recording their responses. This process will help you understand how to gather information about languages in linguistics.

#### B. Importance of Field Work and Data Collection

Field work and data collection are essential components of linguistic research. By working with a native speaker, you can gain insights into the structure and usage of their language. This experience will also teach you important skills such as asking effective questions, being organized, and adapting to unexpected responses.

#### C. The Instructor's Example: Martian Language

To demonstrate how to collect data and generate hypotheses about a language, the instructor will create a fictional language called Martian. You will learn how to present data in linguistics, including writing down unfamiliar sounds and translating sentences into English. This exercise will help you understand the process of gathering information about languages.

### II. Understanding Language Structure
#### A. Morphology: The Study of Word Structure

Morphology is the study of word structure and how morphemes (smallest units of language) combine to form words. In linguistics, when working with a language, it's essential to understand that there are no strict guidelines about what to work on. To be prepared, think about other things you'd like to know, such as getting a paradigm of pronouns or verbs in the present tense.

#### B. Universals in Language

One universal aspect of language is the arbitrariness of the sign, which means that words don't necessarily follow from anything else about a language. For example, the word "cat" doesn't have any inherent connection to its meaning.

### III. The Mental Lexicon and Morphology
#### A. The Concept of the Mental Lexicon

The mental lexicon is the dictionary in a speaker's mind that contains words and morphemes (parts of words). This concept suggests that human beings divide words into parts, which can be productive, meaning they can be applied to novel words.

#### B. Types of Morphemes

Morphemes are classified as free or bound, with free morphemes standing alone and bound morphemes requiring attachment to another word. Examples include the plural morpheme in English (a suffix) and the freestanding word for plural in Tagalog.

### IV. Terminology and Concepts
#### A. Key Terms: Morphemes, Roots, Affixes, Free and Bound Morphemes

*   **Morphemes**: parts of words that have meaning.
*   **Roots**: the base form of a word to which prefixes or suffixes can be added.
*   **Affixes**: things that you add to roots.
*   **Free morphemes**: don't require additional elements to function as a word.
*   **Bound morphemes**: require attachment to another word.

#### B. Open and Closed Class Morphemes

Open class morphemes are those for which new members can be created, such as nouns like Xerox or verbs like Google. Closed class morphemes, on the other hand, are those that cannot be easily added to, such as prepositions like in or at.

### V. Examples of Language Variation
#### A. The Poem Jabberwocky

The nonsense words used in the poem Jabberwocky from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland provide a literary example of open and closed class morphemes. Replacing closed class morphemes with nonsense would make the poem difficult to understand.

#### B. Types of Affixes and Morphology

Other languages, like Swahili and Egyptian Arabic, have different types of affixes, including prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and templates. Infixes are affixes that go inside words, while templates involve a string of consonants with vowels inserted between them.

#### C. Reduplication and Other Morphological Processes

Reduplication is another type of morphology found in languages like Tagalog, where the first syllable or consonant is repeated to form a new word. Some languages have unusual morphemes, such as truncation, which involves removing the last consonant from an imperfect verb form to create its perfect counterpart.

#### D. Tonal Languages and Unpronounced Morphemes

Tonal languages exist, where the pitch and tone of a word affect its meaning. Additionally, there are cases where morphemes may not be pronounced at all, but still contribute to the meaning of a word.

### VI. Conclusion
In conclusion, understanding language structure is crucial for effective data collection and linguistic research. By grasping concepts such as morphology, universals in language, and terminology, you can gain valuable insights into how languages work. Remember that field work and data collection are essential components of linguistic research, and being prepared to adapt to unexpected responses is key to success.
