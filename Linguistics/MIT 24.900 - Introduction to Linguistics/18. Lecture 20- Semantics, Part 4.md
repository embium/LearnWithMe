### I. Binding Theory Overview
#### A. Introduction to Binding Theory

Binding theory is a linguistic concept that aims to explain how different elements in a sentence interact and are related to each other. It provides a framework for understanding the structure and meaning of language, particularly when it comes to pronouns, anaphors, and referring expressions. The theory was developed to account for facts like those presented on this slide, where two sentences with different meanings can be grammatical.

#### B. Key Concepts in Binding Theory

- **Anaphors**: Words like "herself" that require a co-referent within the same domain.
- **Pronouns**: Words like "her" that refer to a specific person or thing, but can also be free within the smallest TP (Tense Phrase) containing them.
- **Reflexives** and **Reciprocals**: Both have the same behavior in binding theory, but differ in meaning. Reflexives, such as "herself," refer back to the subject of the sentence, while reciprocals, like "each other," can refer to multiple entities.

#### C. Principles A, B, and C

- **Principle A**: Anaphors must be bound by a noun phrase within the same TP (Tense Phrase).
- **Principle B**: Pronouns must also be free within the same TP.
- **Principle C**: Referring expressions, which are not anaphors or pronouns, must be free everywhere in the sentence. This principle helps explain why certain sentences, such as "she likes Susan," are grammatically acceptable despite violating principles A and B.

#### D. Binding Theory and Linguistic Phenomena

- **Subject Control** and **Object Control**: The understood subject of an embedded clause is determined by the higher verb phrase.
- **Invisible Pronouns**: May be necessary to explain the behavior of certain expressions, such as "defend yourself," which implies a subject that co-refers with "you."

### II. Successive Cyclic Movement and Reconstruction
#### A. Introduction to Successive Cyclic Movement

Successive cyclic movement is a syntactic process that allows for the reordering of phrases within a sentence. This phenomenon enables the analysis of complex sentences, such as "which picture of himself did John think that Mary bought?" In this example, the phrase "picture of himself" starts as the sister of "like," but moves to become the specifier of a higher CP.

#### B. Reconstruction and Successive Cyclic Movement

- **Reconstruction**: A moved phrase is treated as though it hadn't moved at all.
- **Successive Cyclic Movement**: The movement of phrases through multiple positions within the sentence, allowing John to command "picture of himself" from different points.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. Summary of Binding Theory and Successive Cyclic Movement

Binding theory provides a framework for understanding how different elements in a sentence interact and are related to each other. It offers insights into the structure and meaning of language, particularly when it comes to pronouns, anaphors, and referring expressions. The concept of successive cyclic movement allows for the reordering of phrases within a sentence, enabling the analysis of complex sentences.

#### B. Implications of Binding Theory

- **Understanding Sentence Structure**: Binding theory provides a framework for understanding how different elements in a sentence interact.
- **Analyzing Complex Sentences**: Successive cyclic movement enables the analysis of complex sentences, such as those involving reconstruction and multiple phrase movements.
