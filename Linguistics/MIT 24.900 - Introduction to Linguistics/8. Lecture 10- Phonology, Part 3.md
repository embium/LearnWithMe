### I. Harmony in Languages: An Overview
#### A. Introduction to Vowel and Sibilant Harmony

Harmony is a crucial aspect of phonology in languages like Turkish, Finnish, Navajo, and others. It refers to the way vowels or consonants within words assimilate to each other's properties, creating specific sound patterns. There are two primary types of harmony: Vowel Harmony and Sibilant Harmony.

#### B. Vowel Harmony

Vowel Harmony is a phenomenon where vowels in a word change their properties (such as front or back quality) to harmonize with the existing vowels. This type of harmony occurs in languages like Finnish, Turkish, and Navajo. For example:

*   In Finnish, the suffix "LA" changes its vowel depending on the noun it's attached to, ensuring that the resulting word has a consistent sound pattern.
*   In Navajo, the prefix "sh-" changes its form based on whether it's followed by a voiced or voiceless consonant.

#### C. Sibilant Harmony

Sibilant Harmony is another type of harmony where consonants like "s" or "z" influence the form of morphemes in a word. In Navajo, for instance:

*   The prefix "sh-" changes its form depending on whether it's followed by a voiced or voiceless consonant.

#### D. Implications and Broader Context

These types of harmony are not unique to these specific languages but have broader implications for understanding sound patterns across languages. Languages often have specific problems, such as disliking sequences of three consonants in a row, and means to deal with these issues. For example:

*   Navajo and Yawalani both dislike three consecutive consonants but handle this problem differently.
*   By considering phonology as languages having certain problems and then dealing with them, we can see that Navajo and Yawalani share the property of disliking sequences of three consonants in a row.

### II. Phonological Problems and Solutions
#### A. Introduction to Phonological Problems

Languages often have specific problems, such as disliking sequences of three consonants in a row, and means to deal with these issues. For example:

*   Navajo and Yawalani both dislike three consecutive consonants but handle this problem differently.
*   By considering phonology as languages having certain problems and then dealing with them, we can see that Navajo and Yawalani share the property of disliking sequences of three consonants in a row.

#### B. Consonant Sequences

Some languages dislike sequences of three consecutive consonants. For example:

*   Navajo and Yawalani both dislike three consecutive consonants but handle this problem differently.
*   English is fine with three consecutive consonants in a row, but others have rules to avoid this pattern.

#### C. Stress Patterns

Stress patterns can be complex and interact with other constraints. For instance:

*   Some languages have fixed stress positions, while others allow multiple stresses within a word.
*   The stress system in Pintupu, an Aboriginal language of Australia, is based on stressing odd-numbered syllables unless the last syllable is stressed, or two unstressed syllables are consecutive.

#### D. Stress Constraints

Stress constraints can be simple, such as stressing long vowels or putting stress as far left as possible, but figuring out their order of importance creates a complex array of data. For example:

*   In Russian, the suffix "lexical" demands stress on a particular syllable, but nouns like "nut" already have stress on their second syllable, so adding any suffix won't change the stress pattern.
*   In Kashmiri, stress is determined by ranked constraints that prioritize long vowels, vowels with multiple consonants after them, and avoiding final stress.

#### E. English Stress

English stress is even more complicated, with its own set of rules influenced by Germanic and French substrates. To understand English stress, one would need to systematically analyze each vowel's environments and make notes about the patterns that emerge.

### III. Conclusion
Harmony in languages is a complex phenomenon that affects sound patterns within words. Vowel Harmony and Sibilant Harmony are two primary types of harmony found in languages like Turkish, Finnish, Navajo, and others. By considering phonology as languages having certain problems and then dealing with them, we can understand how different languages handle stress patterns and identify commonalities between them.
