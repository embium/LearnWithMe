### I. Language Variation and Cultural Norms
#### A. The Intersection of Language and Culture

Language is deeply intertwined with culture, and the way we speak reflects our cultural background and experiences. In a hypothetical America where board games are extremely popular, chess and checkers are the two dominant games. Families often specialize in one or the other, with children learning to play their family's preferred game from a young age. However, when it comes to school, teachers act as if only checkers exists, and kids from chess families struggle to adapt. This situation highlights the tension between cultural norms and educational expectations.

The metaphor illustrates how language and culture can intersect in complex ways. For instance, some languages have negative polarity items, which are expressions that require negation to be used correctly, such as "I didn't see anything." However, other languages, like Italian and Ukrainian, use a system of negative concord, where the word for "nothing" or "nobody" is marked with negation. This phenomenon is also found in some dialects of English, particularly in areas where positive anymore is used to indicate a change from the past to the present.

#### B. Language Teaching and Cultural Norms

The discussion raises questions about language teaching and the tension between cultural norms and educational expectations. In many cases, language teachers may not be aware of the cultural nuances that affect their students' language use. For example, some students may grow up saying "soda" for fizzy drinks, while others say "pop," and a few might use "Coke" as a default term. This variation is not unique to English; many languages have regional dialects that differ from one another.

Linguists argue that the distinction between language and dialect is often based on political power rather than linguistic differences. The example of Portuguese and Spanish illustrates this point: while they share a common Latin root, their sound systems and vocabularies have diverged over time, making them mutually unintelligible to some extent. Similarly, Mandarin and Cantonese are considered dialects of Chinese due to their shared writing system and grammatical structures, despite having distinct tone systems and phonologies.

#### C. Understanding Language Variation

The concept of "mutual intelligibility" - the ability for speakers of two languages to understand each other - is also nuanced, as there can be one-way intelligibility or even no intelligibility at all. Ultimately, linguists like Noam Chomsky suggest that we should not ask whether two varieties are languages or dialects, but rather focus on understanding the mental grammars and individual languages of speakers, which can then give rise to external languages like English or Mandarin.

### II. Language Diversity and Inclusion
#### A. Recognizing Dialectal Variation

The idea that certain dialects of English, like African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), are inferior or lacking in rules is a misconception. In reality, AAVE has its own set of grammatical structures and rules, which may differ from those of Standard English. For example, AAVE uses negative concord, where multiple negatives can be used together to convey a single idea, whereas Standard English typically requires only one negative.

#### B. The Importance of Context

Additionally, AAVE has a richer tense and aspect system than Standard English, allowing for more nuanced expressions of time and state. The phenomenon of copula drop in AAVE, where the verb "to be" is omitted in certain contexts, is also subject to specific rules and restrictions, similar to those found in Standard English. These differences are not due to laziness or lack of linguistic ability, but rather reflect the unique characteristics of AAVE as a dialect of English.

#### C. Promoting Language Inclusion

By recognizing and understanding these variations, we can work towards a more inclusive and nuanced view of language diversity, acknowledging that all dialects have their own rules and grammatical structures. This approach promotes language inclusion and recognizes the value of diverse linguistic practices in our communities.
