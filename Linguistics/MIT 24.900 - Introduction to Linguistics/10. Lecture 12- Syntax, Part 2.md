### I. Building on Morphology: Understanding Syntax
#### A. Introduction to Syntax

Syntax is the study of how words are combined to form sentences. As we delve into syntax, we're building upon our understanding of morphology, where we've seen how words like "unlockable" can be composed of multiple morphemes. Similarly, when looking at a string of eight words, such as "I will find the book in the garage," we're not just seeing a simple sequence of words - we're dealing with a complex structure that involves merging pairs of things to form larger objects.

#### B. Merging Pairs of Things: A Key Concept in Syntax

In syntax, when we merge two things together, we add labels to the resulting node, and the label of the result is determined by one of the two things being merged. This process is similar to how we combined morphemes earlier, where affixes like "un" come with instructions for combining them with other elements to create new meanings.

#### C. Tree Structures: A Visual Representation of Sentence Structure

Our current tree structures suggest that the string "I will find the book in the garage" could mean either "I will find the book while I'm in my garage" or "The elephant was wearing pajamas." We're going to use tests like topicalization, where we move certain elements to the beginning of the sentence, to determine which tree structure is more likely.

#### D. Topicalization: A Process that Moves a Constituent to the Beginning of a Sentence

Topicalization is a process that moves a constituent to the beginning of a sentence. However, not all constituents can be topicalized, as seen in the example "the elephant I shot in my pajamas." If we try to topicalize the noun phrase "an elephant," it would create ambiguity and lose the result that the tree on the right is the only possible tree.

#### E. Constituency Tests: A Key Tool for Determining Sentence Structure

Constituency tests seem to nail down where the pajamas are in the structure, forcing us to choose between two trees and collapsing the ambiguity. These tests can help us predict facts about reasonably complicated sentences involving multiple entities and clothing.

### II. Understanding Verb Phrases and Constituents
#### A. The Relationship Between Verb Phrases and Their Constituents

The lecturer emphasized that verb phrases can contain prepositional phrases, which can in turn contain noun phrases, creating a potentially infinite structure. This is reflected in our grammar, which allows for arbitrarily long noun phrases, even though no one would ever actually utter such a sentence.

#### B. VP Ellipsis: A Phenomenon Where a Verb Phrase is Omitted

VP Ellipsis is a phenomenon where a verb phrase is omitted, but its presence can be inferred from context. The lecturer hinted at developing a theory that would explain this phenomenon and serve as an additional test for constituent structure.

### III. Kinship Terminology in Tree Structures
#### A. Using Kinship Terminology to Describe Relationships Between Nodes

The lecturer introduced the idea of using kinship terminology to describe relationships between nodes in a tree structure, with terms like "mother," "daughter," and "sister" used to convey dominance and merger relationships.

### IV. Pronouns and Their Reference
#### A. The Complexity of Pronoun Reference

The lecturer presented examples of sentences where pronouns can refer to individuals or groups mentioned earlier or later in the sentence, highlighting the complexity of this phenomenon and the need for a theory that would explain it.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Concepts

In conclusion, syntax is the study of how words are combined to form sentences. We've seen how merging pairs of things can create larger objects, and how tree structures can represent sentence structure. Topicalization and constituency tests have been introduced as key tools for determining sentence structure. Verb phrases and their constituents have also been discussed, along with VP Ellipsis and the use of kinship terminology in tree structures. Pronouns and their reference have been highlighted as a complex phenomenon that requires further study.

#### B. Future Directions

The lecturer hinted at developing a theory that would explain pronoun reference and serve as an additional test for constituent structure. This theory will be revealed in future classes, providing further insights into the complexities of syntax.
