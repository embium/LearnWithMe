### I. Selection and Argumentation in Language
#### A. Introduction to Selectional Relations

Selectional relations are a fundamental concept in syntax, describing how heads (such as verbs or prepositions) select for properties of their sisters (other phrases). This relation is crucial for understanding the structure of sentences and how meaning is conveyed through language.

In a tree diagram representation, selectional relations can be visualized as the head selecting for its sister. For example, in the sentence "The child tickled," the verb "tickle" selects for an object, which is why we have a noun phrase "the child" as its sister. This relation of selection holds between heads and phrases, making it essential to understand how this works in language.

#### B. Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

Some verbs are transitive, meaning they can be followed by an object, while others are intransitive. The verb "tickle" is transitive because we need to know what object it selects for, whereas the preposition "with" is not selective about its sister, as anything can go with a feather.

*   **Key Term:** Transitive verbs select for an object, while intransitive verbs do not.
*   **Example:** The verb "tickle" is transitive because it requires an object, whereas the preposition "with" is not selective about its sister.

#### C. Arguments and Adjuncts

Arguments are phrases that are selected by other heads (such as verbs), while adjuncts are phrases that co-occur with a head without satisfying any selectional requirements. A key test for distinguishing between arguments and adjuncts is VP predominalization: if a verb phrase is replaced with "do so," and a prepositional phrase remains outside of it, that phrase had better be an adjunct rather than an argument.

*   **Key Term:** Arguments are phrases selected by other heads, while adjuncts co-occur without satisfying selectional requirements.
*   **Example:** In the sentence "Mary wrote on the typewriter the novel," the prepositional phrase "on the typewriter" is an adjunct because it doesn't satisfy any selectional requirement of the verb "wrote."

#### D. The Projection Principle

The projection principle dictates that when constructing trees, selectional requirements must be satisfied before merging other phrases. This principle helps explain why certain word orders are more acceptable in English and other languages.

*   **Key Term:** The projection principle ensures that selectional requirements are met before merging other phrases.
*   **Example:** In the sentence "Mary wrote the novel on a typewriter," the verb "wrote" selects for an object, which is why the noun phrase "the novel" must be merged with it first.

#### E. Challenges and Variations

The concept of currying becomes relevant when dealing with verbs like "put," which don't just select for two noun phrases but also require them to be in a specific order. The diversity in how multiple wh-questions are formed across languages suggests that the rules governing wh-movement might be more complex than initially thought.

*   **Key Term:** Currying is a concept where a function takes one argument and returns another function that takes an additional argument.
*   **Example:** In English, the wh-word "what" can move to the beginning of the sentence when forming questions, but this is not universally true across languages; some languages, like Chinese, don't allow wh-words to move at all.

#### F. Universal Grammar and Language Acquisition

The concept of Universal Grammar comes into play when considering how humans acquire language; despite exposure to varying numbers of wh-words in questions, children seem to develop a consistent grammar for forming multiple wh-questions, moving all wh-words to the beginning of the sentence. This phenomenon is attributed to the human mind's ability to construct language in certain ways but not others, leading to the idea that there might be an innate Universal Grammar that guides language acquisition.

*   **Key Term:** Universal Grammar refers to the innate knowledge humans have for constructing language.
*   **Example:** Children seem to develop a consistent grammar for forming multiple wh-questions, moving all wh-words to the beginning of the sentence, despite exposure to varying numbers of wh-words in questions.
