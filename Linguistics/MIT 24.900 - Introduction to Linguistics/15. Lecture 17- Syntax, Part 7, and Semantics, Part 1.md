### I. Syntax Overview
#### A. Introduction to Shortest Move

Syntax is a crucial aspect of linguistics that deals with the rules and patterns governing how words are combined to form sentences in languages. One fundamental concept in syntax is the shortest move, which refers to the idea that when two movement operations are possible, we choose the shorter one. This concept plays a significant role in explaining why certain movements are possible while others aren't.

The shortest move principle helps us understand various phenomena in language, such as head movement constraints and superiority judgments. For instance, in English, forming yes-no questions by moving T into C is possible, but not by moving the verb into C past the auxiliary. This constraint is extremely strong and has been statistically significant across thousands of languages on the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS).

#### B. Examples of Shortest Move

- **Head Movement Constraint:** In English, heads can only move over short distances. For example, forming yes-no questions by moving T into C is possible, but not by moving the verb into C past the auxiliary.
  
- **Superiority Judgments:** When there are conflicting requirements, we prefer moving the higher wh phrase over the lower one. This principle helps us understand why certain movements are preferred over others.

- **Wh Islands:** Wh islands refer to positions that you can't move out of. One theory for why this happens is that shortest move is trying to make a question but gets stuck because there's another wh phrase in the way, creating a conflict between two constraints: shortest move and the requirement to form a question.

#### C. Unifying Phenomena with Shortest Move

The concept of shortest move is part of a larger literature where syntacticians try to unify various phenomena into a single theory. This approach helps us understand how different aspects of language are interconnected and governed by similar principles.

### II. Dinka Language Overview
#### A. Phonology System

The Dinka language, spoken by about two million people in South Sudan and diaspora communities, features a complex phonology system with long and short vowels, three levels of vowel length, and tone. It also includes creaky and breathy voice, which are used to distinguish between different words.

#### B. Syntax Features

Dinka is a V2 language, meaning that the first position in every clause must be filled by some phrase. Additionally, it has another position right before the verb that must also be occupied if there is a noun phrase object. This second position can't be left empty, even when asking a question with a wh-word.

#### C. Evidence for Successive Cyclic Movement

Dinka's syntax provides evidence for Chomsky's idea of successive cyclic movement, where wh-movement involves moving in a series of little hops rather than one big jump. The language also has a distinction between singular and plural versions of wh-words, which is reflected in the morphology of the language.

### III. Semantics Overview
#### A. Compositionality

In semantics, we're studying how to make meanings out of smaller meanings. The idea that something like compositionality should hold suggests that if you completely understand the meanings of the various parts of the sentence, there ought to be a simple set of rules for combining those meanings to get the meaning of the sentence.

#### B. Meaning Relations

We've discussed meaning relations involving words, such as synonyms and antonyms, and how to refer to individuals using different phrases or expressions. We've also touched on entailment relations between sentences, where one sentence entails another if whenever the first is true, the second must be true.

#### C. Presuppositions vs. Implicatures

Presuppositions are a type of relation between sentences, where one sentence assumes or implies another sentence to be true. Unlike entailments, which require the truth of the implied sentence for the original sentence to be true, presuppositions must be true for either the original sentence or its negation to be true.

- **Example:** "The present King of France is bald" presupposes that there is a present King of France.
  
Implicatures are inferences or suggestions made by a sentence without necessarily being true. They can be false under certain circumstances, and their falsity does not affect the truth value of the original sentence.

- **Determining Entailments, Presuppositions, and Implicatures:** To determine whether a sentence is an entailment, presupposition, or implicature, one should ask if it must be true for the original sentence to be either true or false, just true if the original sentence is true, or simply something that might be thought to be true but could be false.
