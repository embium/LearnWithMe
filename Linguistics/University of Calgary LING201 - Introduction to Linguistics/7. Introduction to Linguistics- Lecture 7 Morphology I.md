### I. Introduction to Morphology
#### A. Overview of Word Structure

Morphology is the study of word structure, focusing on how words are formed from smaller units called morphemes. Words are the smallest free forms of a language, carrying inherent meaning, whereas sounds and syllables don't inherently carry meaning. Understanding morphology helps us comprehend how words can be broken down into meaningful parts, enabling us to analyze and generate new words.

#### B. Key Terms and Concepts

*   **Morpheme**: A single unit of meaning in a word, which can be a root, affix, or stem.
*   **Allomorph**: Surface forms of a meaningful morpheme with multiple instantiations depending on its environment.
*   **Root**: The core part of a word that carries lexical meaning, often pronounced without affixes.
*   **Affix**: A bound morpheme attached to a root or existing word to form a new word.

### II. Types of Morphemes and Allomorphs
#### A. Roots

Roots are the core parts of words that carry inherent meaning. They can be combined with various affixes to create different words. For example, in Spanish, the root "comer" (to eat) can be combined with affixes to form words like "comiendo" (eating) or "comedores" (eaters).

#### B. Affixes

Affixes are bound morphemes attached to roots or existing words to form new words. There are several types of affixes:

*   **Prefix**: An affix attached before the root, such as "un-" in "unhappy."
*   **Suffix**: An affix attached after the root, such as "-ed" in "happened."
*   **Infix**: An affix inserted within the root, such as "k" in some Arabic words.
*   **Circumfix**: An affix that surrounds the root, such as "be-" and "-ing" in English.

### III. Derivational Morphology
#### A. Definition

Derivational morphology involves adding affixes to roots or existing words to create new words with distinct meanings. This process can change the lexical category of a base word, such as turning verbs into nouns or adjectives into verbs.

#### B. Examples in English

In English, derivational morphology often uses suffixes to create new words. For example:

*   Adding the suffix "-er" to "write" forms the noun "writer."
*   Adding the suffix "-ly" to "happy" forms the adjective "happily."

### IV. Compounding
#### A. Definition

Compounding is a type of derivation that involves combining two roots or stems to form a new word. This process can create nouns, adjectives, or verbs with distinct meanings.

#### B. Examples in English

In English, compounding often involves combining two roots or stems to form a new word. For example:

*   Combining "sun" and "flower" forms the compound noun "sunflower."
*   Combining "book" and "shelf" forms the compound noun "bookshelf."

### V. Tree Structures for Visualizing Word Structure
#### A. Overview

To visualize word structure, we can use tree structures to map morphological structure. This involves color-coding bases in red and affixes in blue.

#### B. Example

For example, the word "unhappiness" can be represented as a tree structure:

*   Root: "happy"
*   Prefix: "un-"
*   Suffix: "-ness"

This visual representation helps us understand how words are formed through concatenative morphology, where roots carry core lexical meaning and are pronounced without affixes.
