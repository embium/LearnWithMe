### I. Meaning and Context in Language Use
#### A. Overview of Context's Role in Resolving Ambiguity

Context plays a crucial role in resolving ambiguity in language use. Different types of ambiguity, including lexical and structural, can be resolved by other words or sentences within the discourse. However, some parts of language are inherently ambiguous, such as pronouns, which rely on context to provide meaning.

#### B. Types of Ambiguity

There are several types of ambiguity that can arise in language use:

*   **Lexical Ambiguity**: This occurs when a word has multiple meanings or interpretations.
*   **Structural Ambiguity**: This arises when the structure of a sentence or phrase is unclear, leading to multiple possible interpretations.

#### C. Indexical Parts of Speech

Indexical parts of speech, including pronouns, adverbs, and some adjectives, get their specific referent from the context in which they're used. For example:

*   **Pronouns**: Words like "I" or "you" rely on context to provide meaning.
*   **Adverbs**: Adverbs like "today" or "tomorrow" get their specific referent from the day of the utterance.
*   **Adjectives**: Some adjectives, such as scalar adjectives like "large" or "fluffy," have a relative scale that depends on the noun they're modifying.

#### D. Context-Dependent Adjectives

Context-dependent adjectives have meanings constrained to the specific context in which they're modifying a noun. For example:

*   **Scalar Adjectives**: Adjectives like "large" or "fluffy" have a relative scale that depends on the noun they're modifying.
*   **Relativity**: The relativity we're talking about is related to the relative scale of adjectives, which depends on the noun they're modifying.

#### E. Presuppositions

Presuppositions are implicit assumptions made by language users when using language. They're critical in understanding how language is used to convey meaning and context. In linguistics, presuppositions are implicit assumptions that underlie a sentence's meaning. These assumptions can be difficult to negate through simple negation of the sentence itself.

#### F. Examples of Presuppositions

Presuppositions can arise from various elements, including:

*   **Definite Articles**: Saying "I found your toque collection" implies that the collection exists and belongs to you.
*   **Possessives**: Using possessive pronouns like "my" or "your" implies ownership or possession.
*   **Factive Predicates**: Factive predicates, such as "know" or "believe," imply the existence of a fact or truth.

#### G. Presuppositions in Advertising and Persuasion

Presuppositions play a crucial role in advertising, persuasion, and deceit. They can be used to imply truths that are not explicitly stated. In fact, lying often involves presupposing something is true when it's not.

#### H. Conversational Implicature

Conversational implicature relies on the cooperative principle and conversational maxims to convey meaning beyond what is explicitly stated. By analyzing how people break or flout these maxims, we can gain insight into their intentions and underlying meanings.

### I. Conclusion
Context plays a vital role in resolving ambiguity and conveying meaning in language use. Understanding indexical parts of speech, context-dependent adjectives, presuppositions, and conversational implicature is essential for analyzing how language is used to convey meaning and context.
