### I. Introduction to Linguistic Morphology
#### A. Overview of Morphology

Welcome back to Link201, an introduction to linguistics. Today's discussion continues on linguistic morphology, our second week of exploring this topic. The readings for today cover the second half of our morphology chapter in Contemporary Linguistic Analysis, Chapter Four, Sections Four through Six.

Morphology is a crucial aspect of linguistics that deals with the internal structure and formation of words. It examines how words are built from smaller units called morphemes, which can be combined to form new words or modify existing ones. Understanding morphology is essential for grasping the complexities of language and its various forms.

#### B. Acknowledging Indigenous Territories

Before we begin our discussion on morphology, it's essential to acknowledge the land we're learning in. The city of Calgary lies within the territory of Treaty Seven, signed by representatives of the Blackfoot Confederacy, the Stoney Nakoda, and the Métis Nation of Alberta.

### II. Inflectional Morphology
#### A. Definition and Examples

Inflectional morphology deals with grammatical meaning more than lexical meaning, focusing on shades of grammatical distinctions such as tense, aspect, number (singular or plural), and person (first, second, or third). English has a limited number of inflectional morphemes, all of which are suffixes.

For example, the plural suffix (-s) indicates that there's more than one object being referred to. Other examples include:

*   The past tense suffix (-ed) on verbs like "walk" and "talk"
*   The third-person singular present tense suffix (-s or -es) on verbs like "he walks" and "she eats"

Inflectional morphology is essential for conveying grammatical information in language.

#### B. Distinctions between Inflection and Derivation

While inflection deals with grammatical meaning, derivation focuses on lexical meaning. Derivational affixes can change the lexical category of a word or add new meanings that are not just grammatical.

Inflectional affixes must apply after any derivational affixes have been added, and once inflection has applied, further derivation is not possible in English.

### III. Non-Affixational Morphological Processes
#### A. Internal Changes within Words

Internal changes within words can indicate inflectional differences. For example:

*   Vowel changes in strong verbs like "sing" and "sang"
*   Stem-changing verbs in Spanish, which change the verb's form to indicate different meanings
*   The umlaut process in Germanic languages, such as German, which indicates plurality by changing vowels

#### B. Subpletion

Subpletion is another type of internal change, where the entire word changes to indicate different grammatical meanings.

English has a few examples of subpletion, including:

*   The verb "be" and its various forms like "am," "is," and "are"
*   Other languages, like French, also exhibit subpletion with verbs like "avoir" and "être"

#### C. Reduplication

Reduplication is a process used in some languages to express grammatical information or other meaning differences by repeating parts of words.

English does not typically use reduplication, but it can be seen in Australian languages like Tagalog and Ilocano.

### IV. Interactions between Morphology and Phonology
#### A. Tone

Tone is another way phonology can be used to indicate different meanings in morphology.

Some languages, such as Monobili, express inflectional grammatical information through tones.

A change in tone can indicate past and future tenses, among other meanings.

#### B. Clitics

Clitics are shortening contractions that make free lexical words bound to something else.

English uses clitics with "am" becoming "'m" when attached to "I," "is" becoming "'s" when attached to its subject, and "br" becoming "r" when attached to its subject.

Romance languages like Spanish and French also use object pronouns as clitics.

### V. Word Formation Processes
#### A. Conversion

Conversion is a process where new words are formed without adding affixes by changing the lexical category of a word in context.

This can be seen with verbs being used as nouns or adjectives, and vice versa.

Stress shift often accompanies conversion to match prosodic rules for different categories.

#### B. Clipping

Clipping involves shortening longer words to form new ones.

English uses clipping with "zoo" from "zoological," "fan" from "fanatic," and "vet" from "veterinarian."

Nicknames are also a type of clipping, where names like "Mike" and "Lizzy" come from "Michael" and "Elizabeth."

#### C. Blending

Blending is another process that forms new words by combining parts of existing words.

English uses blending with "email" from "electronic mail" and "froyo" from "frozen yogurt."

Japanese also employs blending to form "karaoke" from "kara" meaning empty and "okay" meaning orchestra.

#### D. Back Formation

Back formation involves removing parts of words that seem like affixes to create new words.

This process is seen in English with words like "forecast," which was formed by removing the prefix "fore-" from "forecaster."

The process of forming new words in English involves several mechanisms, including back formation, where a verb is created from a noun by removing a suffix.

For example, the word "orientate" was formed from "orientation," and "edit" was formed from "editor."

This process can also be seen with words like "euthanize," which was derived from "euthanasia."
