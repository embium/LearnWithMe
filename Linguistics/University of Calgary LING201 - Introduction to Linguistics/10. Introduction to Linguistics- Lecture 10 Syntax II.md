### I. Complements and Sentence Structure
#### A. Overview of Complements

Complements are a crucial aspect of sentence structure, playing a vital role in the formation of meaningful sentences. In this section, we will delve into the world of complements, exploring their types, functions, and interactions with different heads.

- **Definition:** Complements are optional elements that accompany a head in a tree-like diagram, occupying the position adjacent to the head.
- **Types:** Complements can take various forms, including noun phrases (NPs), adjective phrases (APs), prepositional phrases (PPs), and complement clauses.

#### B. Heads and Their Complements

Different heads can combine with various complements, resulting in distinct sentence structures. Let's examine how different heads interact with complements:

- **Verbs:** Verbs are the primary head of a sentence, and they can take direct objects (DOs), indirect objects (IOs), or prepositional phrases as complements.
  - Example: "The lion devours the gazelle" (DO)
  - Example: "I bake them a cake" (IO)

- **Nouns:** Nouns typically only take prepositional phrases as complements within their noun phrase.
  - Example: "the book on the table"

- **Adjectives:** Adjectives, like nouns, prefer prepositional phrases as complements but can also have a complement clause.
  - Example: "the city where I grew up"
  - Example: "the class knows that linguistics is fun" (complement clause)

- **Prepositions:** Prepositions can take various types of complements, including noun phrases and prepositional phrases.
  - Example: "in the park" (NP)
  - Example: "under the bridge" (PP)

#### C. Complement Clauses

Complement clauses are whole sentences acting as complements to another sentence. They can be embedded within other clauses, creating infinitely long declarative sentences.

- **Example:** "The class knows that linguistics is fun"
- **Embedded Clauses:** Complement clauses can be embedded within other clauses, such as:
  - Example: "I think that the class knows that linguistics is fun"

### II. Sentence Structure and Tree Diagrams
#### A. Overview of Sentence Structure

Sentences are structured as a tree-like diagram, with various components such as subject, verb, and auxiliary verbs.

- **Head:** The head of the sentence is typically the verb.
- **Movement:** In English, yes/no questions involve moving the auxiliary verb from the t position up into the c position, creating a plus q feature that indicates a question.

#### B. Question Formation

Yes/no questions and content questions differ in their movement patterns:

- **Yes/No Questions:**
  - Example: "Does she like ice cream?"
  - Movement: Auxiliary verb moves to the c position, creating a plus q feature.
- **Content Questions:**
  - Example: "What is her favorite food?"
  - Movement: Wh word (e.g., what) moves to the specifier position of the c head, accompanied by auxiliary verb movement.

### III. Universal Grammar and Parametric Variation
#### A. Overview of Universal Grammar

Universal grammar theory proposes that all human languages share a common underlying structure, with differences arising from parametric variation.

- **Common Structure:** All human languages have a similar deep structure before movement.
- **Parametric Variation:** Parameters like the head-complement parameter and v-to-t movement parameter influence language-specific features, such as verb placement and adverb positioning.

#### B. Parametric Variation

Parameters like the head-complement parameter and v-to-t movement parameter shape language-specific features:

- **Head-Complement Parameter:**
  - Example: English allows prepositional phrases to appear before or after the noun.
- **V-to-T Movement Parameter:**
  - Example: French's unique verb-adverb ordering is influenced by this parameter.

### IV. Upcoming Quiz and Semantics
#### A. Upcoming Quiz

The upcoming quiz on syntax, scheduled for this Friday via D2L, is a priority, with Quiz Number Four being the focus.

- **Preparations:** Students are expected to review material covered in previous lectures and readings.
- **Readings:** Chapter 6 of Contemporary Linguistic Analysis, sections 0 through 3, will be covered next week.

#### B. Semantics

Semantics will be explored next week, building upon hints provided throughout the course about the importance of meaning in language analysis.

- **Preparations:** Students are expected to review material on syntax and prepare for discussions on semantics.
- **Readings:** Chapter 6 of Contemporary Linguistic Analysis, sections 0 through 3, will provide a foundation for semantic analysis.
