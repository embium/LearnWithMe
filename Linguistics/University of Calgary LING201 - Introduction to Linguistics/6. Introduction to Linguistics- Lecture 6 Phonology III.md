### I. Phonology Overview
#### A. Introduction to Derivations and Phonological Rules

Phonology is the study of sound patterns in spoken languages. In Week Six of the semester, we're discussing phonology, specifically derivations and phonological rules. The process of transferring information from sound into meaning is called derivation, which involves applying zero or more formal rules to change an underlying form into a surface form.

#### B. Levels of Representation

There are two levels of representation of sounds in spoken languages: the **phonemic level** (abstract meaningful segments) and the **phonetic level** (concrete articulated segments). The phonemic level represents the sound patterns that distinguish meaning between words, while the phonetic level represents the actual sounds produced when speaking.

#### C. Derivation Process

The derivation process involves applying zero or more formal rules to change an underlying form into a surface form. This process can be illustrated using diagrams, starting with the input (underlying representation), followed by ordered sets of rules that apply to the input, and ending with the output (phonetic representation).

### II. Phonological Rules
#### A. Rule Application

Phonological rules are applied in a specific order to derive the surface form from the underlying form. The output is the phonetic representation, which matches almost identically to the underlying representation in some cases.

#### B. Rule Ordering and Relationships

The order of rules can matter, especially when one rule creates a conditioning environment for another rule. A **feeding relationship** occurs when one rule creates the conditioning environment for another rule, while a **bleeding relationship** occurs when a rule destroys the conditioning environment for another rule.

### III. Specific Phonological Rules
#### A. Aspiration and Vowel Lengthening

We'll examine specific rules, such as aspiration of stops in English and vowel lengthening before voiced obstruents inside the same syllable, using feature matrices to describe what's happening at each level of derivation.

#### B. Schwa Insertion Rule

We'll practice formulating a rule based on an observation that most dialects of English do not permit nasals to follow stops and onsets, resulting in schwa insertion between the consonants. This will involve identifying the features of the stop and nasal consonants and using them to describe the conditioning environment for the schwa insertion rule.

### IV. Allophones and Phonemes
#### A. Definition and Importance

The concept of **allophones** and **phonemes** is crucial in understanding the complexities of language. Allophones are variant forms of a phoneme that occur under specific conditions, while phonemes are the abstract sound units that distinguish meaning between words.

#### B. Examples from English and German

In English, the phoneme /l/ has two main allophones: the velarized or dark variant, represented by a tilde (~) above the letter, which occurs after vowels, and the light variant, which occurs everywhere else. In German, allophones can also occur in complementary distribution, meaning they appear together but with different properties.

#### C. Feature Matrices and Rule Formulation

We'll use feature matrices to describe what's happening at each level of derivation and formulate rules based on observations about sound patterns in spoken languages.
