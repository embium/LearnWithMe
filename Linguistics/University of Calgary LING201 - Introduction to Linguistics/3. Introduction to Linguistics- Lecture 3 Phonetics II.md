### I. Introduction to Vowel Spectra in English
#### A. Overview of Vowels

Welcome back to Lean 201 Introduction to Linguistics! This week, we'll continue discussing phonetics, focusing on vowels. Our readings for today include the second half of Contemporary Linguistic Analysis Chapter 2, Section 6-10. As a newcomer to this land, I strive to learn about its peoples, languages, and history.

#### B. Types of Vowels

There are two types of vowels: simple (monophthongs) and diphthongs. Simple vowels have a constant quality throughout their duration, while diphthongs exhibit different qualities at the beginning and end. Semi-vowels are used to transcribe the second half of English diphthongs.

#### C. Vowel Height

Vowel height refers to how high or low the tongue body is in the mouth when producing a vowel sound. In English, vowels can range from high to low, with mid vowels in between. For example:

* High vowels: /i/, /u/ (as in "hit" and "put")
* Mid vowels: /ɛ/, /ɔ/ (as in "bet" and "got")
* Low vowels: /a/ (as in "father")

#### D. Vowel Backness

Vowel backness refers to how far back the tongue body is in the mouth when producing a vowel sound. In English, vowels can be front, central, or back.

* Front vowels: /i/, /ɛ/, /e/ (as in "hit", "bet", and "pet")
* Central vowels: /ə/ (as in "about")
* Back vowels: /u/, /o/, /a/ (as in "put", "got", and "father")

#### E. Rounding

Rounding distinguishes vowels based on lip shape, with some languages using this feature more prominently than others.

* Rounded vowels: /y/, /ʊ/ (as in "yes" and "boot")
* Unrounded vowels: /i/, /u/, /e/, /o/ (as in "hit", "put", "pet", and "got")

#### F. Tenseness vs. Laxness

The final distinction we'll cover is tenseness vs. laxness, a unique characteristic of English vowels. This distinction can divide vowels into pairs, with one member being tense and the other lax.

* Tense vowels: /i/, /u/, /e/, /o/ (as in "hit", "put", "pet", and "got")
* Lax vowels: /ɛ/, /ɔ/, /a/ (as in "bet", "got", and "father")

### II. Describing English Vowels
#### A. Parameters for Describing Vowels

To describe English vowels, we use parameters like height, backness, rounding, and tenseness. A standard order for describing vowels is: height, backness, roundness, and then tenseness.

* Height: /i/, /u/ (high), /ɛ/, /ɔ/ (mid), /a/ (low)
* Backness: front (/i/, /ɛ/, /e/), central (/ə/), back (/u/, /o/, /a/)
* Roundness: rounded (/y/, /ʊ/), unrounded (/i/, /u/, /e/, /o/)
* Tenseness: tense (/i/, /u/, /e/, /o/), lax (/ɛ/, /ɔ/, /a/)

#### B. Practicing Vowel Identification

Let's practice using these parameters to identify vowels in words like "lit" and "load".

* In "lit", the vowel is high, front, unrounded, and tense.
* In "load", the vowel is mid, back, rounded, and lax.

### III. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
#### A. Overview of the IPA Chart

The official IPA chart organizes symbols for English in boxes, with front vowels on the left and back vowels on the right. By understanding these parameters and how to navigate the IPA chart, you'll be able to describe and transcribe sounds in English, possibly French, and other languages.

#### B. Parameters of the IPA Chart

The IPA chart is organized by place of articulation, manner of articulation, and voicing, allowing users to identify specific sounds based on their characteristics.

* Place of articulation: /p/, /t/, /k/ (bilabial), /m/, /n/ (alveolar)
* Manner of articulation: stop (/p/, /t/, /k/), continuant (/s/, /z/)
* Voicing: voiced (/v/, /z/), voiceless (/f/, /s/)

#### C. Transcribing Speech Sounds

The IPA chart can be used to transcribe speech sounds, including co-articulation, assimilation, deletion, and metathesis.

* Co-articulation: /p/ and /r/ in "private"
* Assimilation: /ɛ/ becoming nasalized before /n/
* Deletion: /t/ not pronounced in "bought"
* Metathesis: /sk/ becoming /ks/ in "ask"

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Concepts

In this section, we've covered the basics of vowel spectra in English, including types of vowels, vowel height, backness, rounding, and tenseness. We've also explored how to describe English vowels using parameters like height, backness, roundness, and tenseness.

#### B. Next Steps

For next week's class, please review the IPA chart and practice transcribing speech sounds using co-articulation, assimilation, deletion, and metathesis.
