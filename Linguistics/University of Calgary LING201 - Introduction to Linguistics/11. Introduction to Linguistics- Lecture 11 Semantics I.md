### I. Introduction to Semantics
#### A. Overview of the Day's Discussion

The introduction to linguistics covered semantics, focusing on the logical part of meaning. The readings for the day included chapter six of Contemporary Linguistic Analysis, sections zero through three, and announcements regarding deadlines for discussion posts on syntax and semantics, as well as a quiz on semantics and pragmatics.

#### B. Contextualizing the Discussion

The instructor acknowledged learning in the area where the Bow and Elbow rivers meet, known as Mokinstus, which is now referred to as Calgary. This acknowledgment expressed appreciation for the opportunity to learn about the land, its peoples, languages, and history.

### II. Basic Logic and Logical Relations
#### A. Definition of Logic

Logic was defined as the science of distinction and true/false reasoning. Its connection to the meaning of sentences in language was highlighted, emphasizing that knowing the truth value of a sentence allows us to make certain logical conclusions and inferences from its meaning.

#### B. Sentential Relations

The discussion turned to sentential relations, including:

*   **Entailment**: The truth of one sentence requiring another sentence to be true.
*   **Equivalence**: Two sentences having the same truth value.
*   **Contradiction**: A situation where two sentences always had opposite truth values.
*   **Contrariety**: A one-way relationship between two sentences, where if one is true, the other cannot also be true.

Examples were provided for each of these relations to illustrate their application in logical reasoning.

### III. Lexical Relations Between Words
#### A. Overview of Lexical Relations

The discussion then shifted to lexical relations between words, including:

*   **Subordination**: A word being a member of a set represented by another word.
*   **Equivalence**: Two words having the same meaning.
*   **Complementarity**: A situation where the meanings of a set of words did not overlap but exhausted all possibilities within that set.
*   **Incompatibility**: A situation where the meanings of a set of words did not overlap and did not exhaust all possibilities.

#### B. Synonyms, Antonyms, Ambiguity, Homonymy, Polysemy

The discussion also covered:

*   **Synonyms**: Words with almost the same meaning.
*   **Antonyms**: Words with opposite meanings.
*   **Ambiguity**: A single word or phrase having multiple different meanings, which could be clarified by context.
*   **Homonymy**: A situation where a word had multiple meanings that were unrelated.
*   **Polysemy**: Cases where a word had multiple meanings that were related.

### IV. Thematic Roles
#### A. Definition of Thematic Roles

Thematic roles refer to the relationships between entities and actions in language. The discussion covered various thematic roles, including:

*   **Agent Role**: The entity that intentionally does an action denoted by a verb.
*   **Theme or Patient Role**: The entity affected by an action.
*   **Experiencer Role**: The entity experiencing a change of psychological state.
*   **Stimulus Role**: The entity triggering a change of psychological state.
*   **Beneficiary Role**: The entity benefiting from an action.
*   **Goal Role**: The entity towards which an action is directed.
*   **Source Role**: The entity from which an action originates.

#### B. Theta Criterion

The theta criterion states that each thematic role is assigned to exactly one argument, and each argument is assigned exactly one thematic role. This allows for a clear distinction between different types of verbs and their arguments, but does not specify how many thematic roles a verb can assign.
