### I. Introduction to Phonology
#### A. Overview of Syllables and Features

The syllable is a fundamental unit of rhythm in many languages, including English. It consists of one to four segments grouped together into a pronounceable unit. Syllables can have different shapes and sizes across languages, categorized by templates based on the arrangement of segments.

- **Syllable Shapes**: The simplest syllable consists of a single vowel, represented as "v." Other common syllable shapes include CV (consonant-vowel), VC (vowel-consonant), and CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant).

#### B. Phonotactics

Phonotactics are rules governing which segments can combine with each other within a language. These restrictions determine the permissible strings of consonants before and after the nucleus, or core, of the syllable.

- **Sonority Hierarchy**: The sonority hierarchy ranks sounds by their openness or vibrancy, from zero (obstruents) to four (vowels). This hierarchy helps predict which segments can appear before or after the nucleus.
- **Phonotactic Rules**: Understanding phonotactics is essential for learning a new language, as it helps learners recognize which sounds can combine in their target language.

#### C. Syllable Structure Trees

To build a syllable structure tree, identify the nuclei (vowels or syllabic consonants), then portion off the onsets (longest permissible strings of consonants before each nucleus). Associate codas (consonant clusters after each nucleus) to the remaining segments.

- **Building the Tree**: Connect the tree by linking the nucleus and coda to form the rhyme, and the onset and rhyme to form the syllable.
- **Exceptions to the Rule**: Some languages have exceptional cases where the binary requirement is broken, such as with the consonant cluster "str" in words like "stretch".

#### D. Sonority Sequence

The sonority sequence of a syllable typically starts with zero for obstruents, rises to two for liquids, peaks at four for vowels, and then falls back down to one for nasals.

- **Exceptions to the Rule**: Some languages have different sonority sequences or allow exceptions to this rule.
- **Stress Placement**: In English, stress is often assigned to whole syllables, and the weight of each syllable can affect stress placement. Heavy syllables, which include a coda, typically receive stress, while light syllables do not.

### II. Features in Phonology
#### A. Overview of Features

Phonetics involves breaking down sounds into their constituent parts, known as features. These features include manner, laryngeal features, and place features.

- **Manner Features**: Manner features describe the way air flows through the vocal tract, such as nasal or lateral sounds.
- **Laryngeal Features**: Laryngeal features describe what's happening in the larynx, including voice and glottis spread, with voiced sounds produced by vibrating vocal folds and aspirated sounds having a spread glottis.

#### B. Place Features

Place features describe where articulation occurs in the mouth or throat, including labial, coronal, and dorsal sounds.

- **Combining Features**: By combining these features, we can redefine segments as meaningful descriptors that can act on their own, allowing for easy accounts of phonological processes and the definition of those processes in derivations and rules.

### III. Land Acknowledgement
#### A. Calgary and Treaty 7 Territory

The syllable is a fundamental unit of rhythm in many languages, including English. It consists of one to four segments grouped together into a pronounceable unit. Syllables can have different shapes and sizes across languages, categorized by templates based on the arrangement of segments.

- **Land Acknowledgement**: We begin with a land acknowledgement, recognizing the area where the Bow and Elbow rivers meet in southern Alberta, known as Mokinstus, now referred to as Calgary. This land lies within Treaty 7 territory, signed by representatives of the Blackfoot Confederacy, Siksika Nation, and Stoney Nakoda First Nation.

### IV. Assignments and Reminders
#### A. Discussion Post

For this week, please note that your second discussion post is due on Thursday in the D2L forum.

- **Quiz**: A quiz for the phonology chapter will be posted on Friday, to be completed by the following Friday.
