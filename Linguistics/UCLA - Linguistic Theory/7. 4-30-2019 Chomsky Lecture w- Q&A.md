### I. The Generative Enterprise: A Traditional Conception of Language
#### A. Overview of the Generative Enterprise

The generative enterprise is a traditional conception of language dating back to the 17th century, focusing on the basic property of language: constructing an infinite array of structured expressions with semantic interpretations. This approach views language as a trait of the person, like the immune system or visual system, which is innately determined and shaped by experience.

#### B. The Bio-Linguistic Program

The bio-linguistic program posits that language is a general mammalian trait, with each language picking its way of settling certain options left open by core grammar. This suggests that parameters, such as subject-verb-object order, are external to the core part of language and don't enter into semantic interpretation.

#### C. The Minimalist Program

The minimalist program seeks genuine explanations by assuming a perfect answer, starting with the simplest computational operation, merge, which forms binary sets from two objects. Merge has two cases: internal merge, where one object is part of the other, and external merge, which requires search. Internal merge is more primitive and can unify compositionality and dislocation.

### II. Implications for Understanding Arithmetic and Its Evolution
#### A. The Emergence of Arithmetic as a Byproduct of Language

A possible answer to the conundrum of arithmetic's fundamental nature is that it's a byproduct of the language faculty, which emerged as a simple computational operation. This would explain why everyone knows arithmetic, but dissociations between arithmetic competence and linguistic competence have been observed.

#### B. The Relationship Between Arithmetic and Language

The discovery that internal merge is simpler than external merge raises questions about why we have both, with implications for understanding arithmetic and its evolution in humans. It's possible that arithmetic was triggered by internal merge alone, which would explain why everyone knows arithmetic.

### III. External Merge and the Properties of Language
#### A. The Use of External Merge to Account for Argument Structure

The existence of external merge has been proposed to account for the properties of language like argument structure and exocentric instructions. This would suggest that the basic operation of language is dislocation, with internal merge being a simpler case of this operation.

### IV. Consciousness and Pre-Conscious Mental Operations
#### A. The Inaccessibility of Core Language to Consciousness

The study of consciousness and pre-conscious mental operations has been impacted by these findings, as it appears that almost everything involved in language is inaccessible to consciousness. This has led to the conclusion that core language, which yields linguistically articulated thoughts, could be universal and part of the faculty of language.

### V. The Variety of Languages: A Surface Phenomenon?
#### A. The Possibility That All Languages Are Variations of a Single Underlying Language

The variety of languages may simply be a surface phenomenon, with only one underlying language that varies in its externalization systems. This would explain why languages change rapidly and have different properties depending on the sensory motor system used for externalization.

### VI. Computational Efficiency vs. Communicative Efficiency
#### A. The Primacy of Computational Efficiency in Language

The study of language has led to a reevaluation of the role of computational efficiency versus communicative efficiency. While it's clear that language is used for communication, it appears that computational efficiency wins out in many cases, leading to parsing problems, perception problems, and communication problems.

### VII. The Doctrine That Language Is Primarily a System of Communication
#### A. The Possibility That This Doctrine May Be False

The doctrine that the function of language is primarily as a system of communication may also be false, as language seems to have come from something entirely different, unrelated to communicative systems.

### VIII. The Human Language Faculty: Favoring Computational Efficiency Over Communicative Efficiency
#### A. The Unique Property of the Human Language Faculty

The human language faculty has a unique property: it favors computational efficiency over communicative efficiency. This means that languages tend to use simple, computationally efficient structures rather than more complex ones that might be more effective for communication.

### IX. Implications for Understanding Human Thought and Cognition
#### A. The Relationship Between Language and Human Thought

The concept of randomness also enters into language, particularly in the sense that humans make choices when using language, which can't be reduced to determinacy or randomness alone. This raises fundamental questions about human knowledge and free will.

### X. The Necessity of Producing Sounds in a Particular Order
#### A. The Influence on the Distribution of Concatenative vs. Non-Concatenative Morphologies

The necessity of producing sounds in a particular order may influence the distribution of concatenative versus non-concatenative morphologies, but this is still an open question.

### XI. The Collapse of the Language Faculty
#### A. The Implications for Children Who Are Not Exposed to Language Data Until Past the Critical Period

The language faculty should collapse in the absence of input, which means that children who are not exposed to language data until past the critical period would likely be impaired in both internal language and externalization aspects.

### XII. The Human Language Capacity: A Remarkable Phenomenon
#### A. The Ability to Develop Complex Linguistic Structures from Relatively Simple Data

The human language capacity is a remarkable phenomenon, allowing individuals to develop complex linguistic structures from relatively simple data. Studies have shown that people who are born with limited or no language exposure can still acquire rich language abilities.

### XIII. Implications for Understanding Human Knowledge and Free Will
#### A. The Relationship Between Language and Human Thought

The ability to understand self-referential paradoxical sentences, such as "this sentence is a lie," also implies that humans have an innate capacity for logical reasoning and linguistic processing.
