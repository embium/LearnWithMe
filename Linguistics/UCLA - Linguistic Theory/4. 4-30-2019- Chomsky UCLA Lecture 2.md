### I. The Generative Enterprise in Linguistics
#### A. Overview of the Generative Enterprise

The generative enterprise in linguistics dates back to the 17th century and focuses on the basic property of language: constructing an infinite array of structured expressions with a semantic interpretation. This approach revives a traditional conception that was later forgotten and then revived without knowledge of the tradition.

#### B. The Bio-Linguistic Program

Within this framework, the bio-linguistic program views language as a trait of the person, similar to the immune system or visual system, which is a particular instance of something more general. The internal language faculty is thought to be innately determined, with experience and other factors governing growth and development.

#### C. Conditions for Genuine Explanations

This approach has led to the notion that genuine explanations must meet two conditions: learnability and evolvability. The early work in this area distinguished between compositionality and dislocation, with the latter being seen as a strange property of language. However, it is now suggested that dislocation may be the simpler case, and that both can be unified under the operation of merge.

#### D. The Minimalist Program

The minimalist program aims to explain language by assuming a perfect answer, starting with the simplest computational operation, and then adding other factors such as data and computational efficiency. If something can be explained in terms of this operation and these factors, it is considered a genuine explanation.

### II. Merge and Language Composition
#### A. The Operation of Merge

Merge has two cases: internal merge, which involves little search and is more primitive, and external merge, which requires searching through the entire lexicon. Recent work has shown that merge can account for compositionality and dislocation, and even the foundations of arithmetic.

#### B. Implications for Language Evolution and Design

The existence of dissociations between arithmetic and linguistic competence seems to contradict the idea that arithmetic and mathematical concepts are innate and universal. However, closer examination reveals that these dissociations may be due to testing performance rather than internal knowledge.

### III. The Fundamental Nature of Language
#### A. Innateness and Universality of Arithmetic Concepts

Some researchers argue that arithmetic and mathematical concepts are innate and universal, while others propose that they emerge from the language faculty. Marvin Minsky's experiments with simple Turing machines suggest that nature may have picked the simplest computational operation, which is merge, as the basis for arithmetic.

#### B. The Role of External Merge in Language Composition

The study of consciousness and pre-conscious mental operations reveals that almost everything involved in language seems inaccessible to consciousness, suggesting that core language, the internal computations yielding linguistically articulated thoughts, may be universal and part of the faculty of language.

### IV. Structure Dependence and Language Acquisition
#### A. The Property of Structure Dependence

Language has a fundamental property of structure dependence, meaning that its rules cannot be learned in a linear order. This is confirmed by neuro-linguistic studies, which have shown that the brain processes language differently depending on whether it's presented in a structured or unstructured way.

#### B. Evidence for Innate Language Acquisition

One study found that subjects who were presented with an invented nonsense language modeled on a real language showed activation in normal language areas of the brain, while those presented with a language that violated universal grammar rules, such as linear order, did not. Similar evidence was presented by another researcher, who studied a person with extremely low cognitive capacities but remarkable language abilities.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. Implications for Language Evolution and Design

The findings suggest that language acquisition is an innate ability, and that the brain is wired to recognize structured language. However, despite this evidence, researchers in computational cognitive science have spent significant time trying to show how language structure could be learned from data without any prior bias or assumptions.

#### B. Future Directions for Research

This effort is unusual, as it's not typical for scientists to try to disprove a null hypothesis when there's already strong evidence supporting it. Further research should focus on exploring the implications of these findings and refining our understanding of language acquisition and evolution.
