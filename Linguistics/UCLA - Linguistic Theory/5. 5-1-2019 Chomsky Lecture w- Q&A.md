### I. Introduction to Linguistic Theories
#### A. Overview of X-bar Theory and the Strong Minimalist Thesis

X-bar theory and the strong minimalist thesis are two influential linguistic theories that have shaped our understanding of human language. Yesterday's discussion focused on their successes in explaining fundamental properties of language, but today we delve into their limitations and implications.

- **X-bar theory** had some successes, such as eliminating major problems with very structure grammar.
- However, it failed to account for excess entry constructions, which are abundant in language.

#### B. Limitations of X-bar Theory

The strong minimalist thesis was proposed to address the issue of excess entry constructions. This approach assumes that the simplest compositional operation is the one that has to be embedded in any computational procedure. However, this raises questions about excess entry constructions and how they can be explained within this framework.

### II. The Concept of Merge
#### A. Definition and Importance of Merge

The concept of merge is a fundamental operation in linguistic theory. It involves combining two elements to form a new one. However, various definitions of merge have been proposed, including parallel merge, late merge, and sideways merge. These proposals have problems with accessibility and the creation of new objects.

#### B. Diagnostic Test for Merge Definitions

A simple diagnostic test has been proposed to determine whether a given definition of merge is legitimate or not. This approach involves identifying legitimate and illegitimate operations for merge, formulating a new definition that captures only the legitimate ones, and explaining why certain definitions fail.

### III. Implications of Merge in Linguistics
#### A. Language Acquisition and Brain Properties

The research program outlined in this lecture has implications for our understanding of language acquisition and the properties of the brain that implement linguistic computation. The concept of merge in linguistics has been extensively studied, with various proposals and definitions being put forth.

- **Legitimate operations**: Only simple forms of merge, such as narrow external and internal merge, are legitimate.
- **Illegitimate operations**: Others, like parallel or sideways merge, are not, as they allow for the creation of results that contradict their inputs.

#### B. Conditions for a Minimal Definition of Merge

A minimal definition of merge must meet three conditions:

1.  It cannot throw out existing workspace elements.
2.  It must be optimal and restrict accessibility as much as possible.
3.  It should not introduce arbitrary junk.

These conditions are based on the principles of minimal computation, resource restriction, and stability.

### IV. The Nature of Thought and Brain Properties
#### A. Constraints on Computation

The explanation for why this is the case lies in the nature of thought and the brain's cognitive system, which imposes constraints on what can be computed.

- **Minimal definition**: A plausible definition of merge that meets these conditions has been proposed.
- **Ambiguity resolution**: However, it raises further questions about the distinction between copies and repetitions.

#### B. Duality of Semantics

The concept of copy is redefined as anything produced by merge, and nothing else, which resolves the ambiguity. However, this still leaves open the question of what constitutes a copy in complex constructions like double object constructions or topicalization.

### V. Rephrasing Merge Using Recursive Processes
#### A. Standard Recursive Processes

The definition of merge can be rephrased using standard recursive processes, where the set of workspaces is defined as the smallest set containing the lexicon and any generated workspace.

- **Stability property**: This approach has been successful in handling various cases, including across-the-board deletion.
- **TB (trace) effect**: However, it relies on the stability property to ensure that deletions are absolute identities.

#### B. Phase Theoretic Considerations

The lack of command between elements can also lead to a TB (trace) effect, which is resolved by considering phase theoretic considerations.

### VI. Integration with Machine Learning and Language Acquisition
#### A. Understanding Human Intelligence

The integration of machine learning and linguistics has been discussed, with some arguing that artificial intelligence should focus on understanding human intelligence rather than just simulating it.

- **Language acquisition**: This approach involves studying language acquisition and integrating it with machine learning.
- **Poverty of the stimulus argument**: Research suggests that children are born with an innate capacity to acquire language, which is shaped by their genetic endowment and universal grammar.

#### B. Misconceptions about Language Acquisition

The concept of language acquisition has long been misunderstood, with many assuming that it's solely based on experience and environment. However, research suggests that this is not the case.

- **Innate capacity**: Children are born with an innate capacity to acquire language.
- **Universal grammar**: This idea was first proposed by a prominent linguist in the 1950s, who challenged the prevailing notion that language is learned from scratch.

### VII. Conclusion
#### A. Implications for Linguistic Theory and AI Development

The research program outlined in this lecture has implications for our understanding of language acquisition and the properties of the brain that implement linguistic computation. The development of corpus linguistics has also led to a focus on data-driven approaches, but this can lead to biased samples and a lack of understanding of the underlying principles of language acquisition.

- **Internal merge**: Internal merge allows for the creation of new accessible items without expanding the workspace.
- **External merge**: External merge reduces the workspace by creating a copy that is not visible due to resource restrictions.
