### I. Introduction to Noam Chomsky's Lecture Series at UCLA
#### A. Overview of the Fourth Lecture

The fourth lecture in a series by Noam Chomsky at UCLA focused on various aspects of syntax, including legitimate and illegitimate operations, the need for an isometric operation, and the challenges of unbounded unstructured coordination. The lecturer also discussed the distinction between strong and weak phases in both nominal and verbal phrases, with implications for extraction and semantic interpretation.

#### B. Acknowledgments and Trivia

The lecture began with acknowledgments to the Dean of Humanities, graduate students Richard Stockwell and Nico Angelo Poulos for their initiative in inviting Chomsky. A piece of trivia was also shared about a bee species named after him, highlighting the intersection of science and linguistics.

### II. Syntax and Merge Operations
#### A. Legitimate and Illegitimate Operations

Chomsky discussed the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate operations in syntax, using the example of parallel merge versus late merge. He emphasized the need for an isometric operation in addition to merge, citing evidence from adjuncts like "young man."

#### B. Unbounded Unstructured Coordination

A major problem in syntax was identified as unbounded unstructured coordination, which cannot be handled by phrase structure grammar or universal rewriting systems. Chomsky proposed a new device, pair emerge, which would apply to simple adjunct cases and allow for the formation of objects that could represent unbounded coordination.

#### C. Strong and Weak Phases

The lecturer discussed the distinction between strong and weak phases in both nominal and verbal phrases, with implications for extraction and semantic interpretation. This distinction is crucial for understanding how language generates an infinite number of structured expressions with semantic interpretations.

### III. Challenges in Syntax and Semantics
#### A. Mapping from Syntax to Formal Semantics

Chomsky highlighted the challenges of mapping syntax to formal semantics, particularly in the case of coordinate structures, which he described as a "huge unsolved problem." This challenge is part of the broader task of making sense of massive data by finding simple ways to explain complex phenomena.

#### B. The Bio-Linguistic Program and Learnability

The study of language has been approached as part of natural science, attempting to capture its basic property: generating an infinite number of structured expressions with semantic interpretations. This project requires meeting the conditions of learnability and evolvability, which are crucial for genuine explanations.

#### C. Reducing Complex Phenomena to Simple Components

A key challenge is reducing complex phenomena to simple, computationally tractable components, such as pair merge, which can be used to explain various aspects of language. However, this approach only arises if one accepts a particular version of what linguistics is, specifically assuming that language is part of natural science and follows the bio-linguistic program.

### IV. Implications for Linguistics and Cognitive Science
#### A. The Scope and Limits of Human Cognitive Capacities

The origins of human symbolic systems are mysterious, with animal systems being based on identifiable physical events, unlike human systems which seem to be arbitrary. This raises questions about the scope and limits of human cognitive capacities, which are still debated among scientists.

#### B. The Relationship between Internal Mental Computations and the Outside World

Chomsky's approach raises questions about how to relate internal mental computations to the outside world, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

#### C. The Notion of Reference and Truth

The notion of reference, which depends on truth, is also problematic, as words like "house" or "River London" do not refer to physical objects in the material world but rather to mental constructions. This suggests that language may not have semantics at all, reducing it to syntax and pragmatics.

#### D. The Intersection of Linguistics and Cognitive Science

The lecture series by Noam Chomsky highlights the intersection of linguistics and cognitive science, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understanding human language and cognition.
