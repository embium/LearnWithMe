### I. Noam Chomsky's Contributions to Linguistics and Cognitive Science
#### A. Early Career and Influences

Noam Chomsky is a renowned figure in linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive science, with an extensive impact on our understanding of language. His career began in the 1940s at Penn University, where he studied under Zellig Harris, a prominent figure in American structuralism. This early influence shaped his approach to linguistics and laid the foundation for his future work.

#### B. Major Contributions

Chomsky's contributions to the field are numerous and significant. His work on generative grammar integrated linguistics into cognitive science and had a profound influence on the decline of behaviorist psychology. Key publications include:

*   "Syntactic Structures" (1957)
*   "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax" (1965)

These works showcased his innovative approach to understanding language, emphasizing its innate properties and internal structure.

#### C. The Minimalist Program

In the 1990s, Chomsky's ideas underwent revisions with the development of the minimalist program. This approach aimed to provide genuine explanation by meeting the conditions of learnability and evolvability. While it made significant progress in reducing complex phenomena to simpler collections of mysteries, the Galilean challenge remains unsolved.

### II. The Development of Modern Science and Linguistics
#### A. From Intelligible Accounts to Theories

The 17th century marked a significant shift from seeking intelligible accounts and an intelligible world to finding intelligible theories. Isaac Newton's work exemplified this change, showing that there are no machines capable of capturing the material world's complexities, leaving the "ghost" or non-mechanical aspects intact.

#### B. Philosophical Implications

Philosophers like John Locke and David Hume built upon Newton's ideas, exploring the implications on our understanding of matter and its properties. They proposed that God may have added non-mechanical properties to matter, such as thought, which was a radical idea at the time.

### III. The Generative Enterprise
#### A. Internalist View of Language

The development of modern linguistics in the 20th century saw a revival of interest in the internalist view of language, which posits that language is an innate property of the human mind. This approach aimed to understand how speakers select expressions from an infinite set generated by the I-language and how these expressions are externalized.

#### B. Challenges and Solutions

However, the first task of determining how a speaker selects a particular expression remains a mystery, with no clear understanding of why one action is selected over another. The Faculty of language faces two empirical conditions: learnability and evolvability. Research has shown that the Faculty of language was already established in modern humans, who appeared around 200,000 years ago.

### IV. The Minimalist Program and Beyond
#### A. Meeting the Conditions

The minimalist program aims to provide genuine explanation by meeting the conditions of learnability and evolvability. This approach seeks to reduce complex phenomena to simpler, more manageable collections of mysteries, which is a major achievement but not yet genuine explanation.

#### B. Challenges and Limitations

Despite its progress, the Galilean challenge remains unsolved, with the first task being to determine how a speaker selects an expression from an infinite set generated by the I-language. The development of phrase structure grammar and transformational grammar in the early 20th century was initially seen as a solution to the problems of compositionality and dislocation.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. Legacy and Impact

Noam Chomsky's contributions to linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive science have had a profound impact on our understanding of language. His work has undergone revisions, particularly with the development of the minimalist program. Despite its limitations, this approach remains an important step towards genuine explanation.

#### B. Future Directions

The challenges and solutions presented in this resource highlight the complexities and mysteries surrounding language. Further research is needed to address these issues and provide a deeper understanding of the human mind's capacity for language.
