### I. Failures in Linguistic Theory: The Concept of Merge
#### A. Introduction to X-bar Theory and its Limitations

X-bar theory was a significant development in linguistic theory, as it eliminated major problems with very structure grammar. However, it also had limitations, particularly in conflating two distinct concepts: joining things together (merge) and identifying their category. This conflation led to difficulties in understanding the nature of merge and its role in language.

#### B. The Strong Minimalist Thesis and Merge

The strong minimalist thesis proposes taking the simplest compositional operation (merge) and seeing how much can be explained in those terms. However, this approach raises an immediate problem: excess entry constructions, which require a workspace to construct subject-predicate constructions. Merge is an operation that takes two things and puts them together, but it must work within the constraints of the workspace.

#### C. The Original Definition of Merge and its Limitations

The original definition of merge incorporated a property that reduces accessibility to computation, but this property was not recognized as such. This oversight has implications for our understanding of language recursion, which may have a similar property, deviating from normal recursion by getting rid of things generated and not allowing access to them.

#### D. The Principle of Reduction of Computation

The principle of reduction of computation is broader than normal explanation, restricting both the means and resources accessible to computation. This has consequences, such as limiting the workspace to be as small as possible. A new definition of merge should restrict accessibility to only one new object, the set P Q, rather than multiple objects.

#### E. The Research Program: Identifying Legitimate Merge Operations

The research program involves identifying legitimate operations for merge and formulating a new definition that captures only those, leaving out illegitimate ones. This requires considering several conditions:

*   The workspace cannot be altered.
*   The new definition of merge must be minimal and optimal, restricting accessibility as much as possible.
*   No arbitrary junk can be introduced.

#### F. Stability in Merge Operations

Stability is essential in understanding computations, particularly when forming topicalizations or deletions, where the system must distinguish between copies and repetitions. The concept of duality in semantics suggests that argument structure is always given by external merge, while non-argument structure properties are provided by internal merge.

#### G. Rephrasing Merge Operations in Terms of Recursive Processes

The process of constructing merge and its application can be rephrased in terms of recursive processes, where the set of workspaces is defined as the transitive closure of the lexicon and containing merge PQ workspace for any PQ and workspace already generated. This definition captures the essence of standard recursive definitions, and it's exactly where we want to be.

### II. Implications and Future Directions
#### A. Implications for Language Acquisition

The principles discussed in this lecture have implications for language acquisition, particularly in phonology and critical periods. The research program aims to identify legitimate operations for merge and formulate a new definition that captures only those, leaving out illegitimate ones.

#### B. Future Research Directions

Future research directions include:

*   Investigating the role of stability in merge operations.
*   Exploring the implications of duality in semantics for argument structure and non-argument structure properties.
*   Developing a more comprehensive understanding of recursive processes and their application to language.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Points

This lecture has explored some failures in linguistic theory, specifically in the concept of merge. We have discussed:

*   The strong minimalist thesis and its implications for excess entry constructions.
*   The original definition of merge and its limitations.
*   The principle of reduction of computation and its consequences.
*   The research program to identify legitimate operations for merge.

#### B. Future Research Directions

Future research directions include investigating the role of stability in merge operations, exploring the implications of duality in semantics, and developing a more comprehensive understanding of recursive processes and their application to language.
