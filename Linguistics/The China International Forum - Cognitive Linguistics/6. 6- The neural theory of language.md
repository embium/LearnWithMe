### I. Embodied Cognition Theory
#### A. Introduction to Embodied Cognition

Embodied cognition theory suggests that many concepts are directly linked to the sensory-motor capacities of our body-brain system, making them embodied. This means that our experiences and perceptions are not separate from our physical bodies but are deeply intertwined with them. The traditional view of concepts posits that they are disembodied, separate from perception and action, and only use human-specific brain mechanisms.

#### B. Neural Theory of Language

The neural theory of language proposes that concepts are meaningful only if they can be simulated or imagined. This capacity for mental simulation is based on the same neural substrate as actual perception and action. The neural theory uses computational modeling mechanisms, specifically structural connectionism, to model the internal structure of concepts and their inferential properties.

#### C. Multimodal Integration in the Premotor Cortex

The premotor cortex, which choreographs actions, is not a uniform field but rather consists of functionally distinct areas that do different things. These areas are reciprocally connected with the parietal cortex, indicating a complex network of parallel functional networks. The cortical premotor areas have sensory properties and respond to visual, somatosensory, and auditory stimuli in addition to choreographing actions.

#### D. Mirror Neurons and Imitation

Mirror neurons, found in area F5c of the monkey's brain, play a crucial role in imitation and empathy. They fire when the monkey performs or observes actions like grasping or holding, indicating that the brain simulates the action being observed. This simulation allows for understanding of actions and is the basis for theories of meaning and simulation semantics.

#### E. Canonical Neurons and Action Understanding

Canonical neurons, found in the premotor cortex, transform intrinsic physical features of objects into hand motor programs requiring action on them. These neurons fire when the monkey performs or observes an action on an object, such as grasping a ring or plate. This demonstrates that the brain has a sophisticated system for understanding actions and their meanings.

#### F. Peri-personal Space Neurons and Simulation

The brain also contains peri-personal space neurons that respond to objects entering personal space, regardless of whether they are being touched or not. This is achieved through simulation, where the sight or sound of an object approaching triggers the simulation of touching it.

### II. Neural Theory of Meaning
#### A. Introduction to Neural Theory of Meaning

The neural theory of meaning proposes that concepts are represented and processed in the brain through a complex network of motor and sensory systems. This theory provides a framework for understanding how the brain represents and processes action-related concepts.

#### B. Premotor and Parietal Areas Integration

The premotor and parietal areas of the brain are neurally integrated, not only controlling action but also constructing an integrated representation of actions, objects acted on, and locations towards which actions are directed. This integration allows for sensory inputs to be transformed into motor and cognitive tasks, such as space perception and action understanding.

#### C. Neural Substructures and Imagination

The same neurons that perform these functions day after day have phases and internal structures, enabling them to cover particular cases and get semantic roles like agent, patient, purpose, and location. These neural substructures also enable imagination and simulation, allowing for the understanding of actions and their meanings.

### III. Cog Hypothesis
#### A. Introduction to Cog Hypothesis

The Cog hypothesis proposes that the meaning of grammatical concepts, which appear in grammar around the world, are computed by secondary structures in the brain. These secondary structures can then be linked to primary structures, enabling abstract reasoning and generalization.

#### B. Controller x-Schema and Grammar

The controller x-schema, developed by Narayanan, models how the same circuitry that controls physical actions can also reason about economics correctly. This schema shows up in the grammar of every language, indicating that the concept of aspect is computed in the brain's secondary structure.

#### C. Language Acquisition and Generalization

In language acquisition, children learn grammar one verb at a time, generalizing new cases based on the connections they already have in their brain's secondary structure. The theory of cogs suggests that generalization is not learning something new but rather inhibiting special case connections to make room for new ones.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Summary

The embodied cognition theory and neural theory of language propose that concepts are deeply intertwined with our physical bodies and sensory-motor capacities. The premotor cortex, mirror neurons, canonical neurons, and peri-personal space neurons demonstrate the complexity and sophistication of the brain's motor and sensory systems.

#### B. Implications

These findings have significant implications for understanding how we represent and process action-related concepts, language acquisition, and generalization. The Cog hypothesis provides a framework for understanding how the brain computes the meaning of grammatical concepts and enables abstract reasoning and generalization.
