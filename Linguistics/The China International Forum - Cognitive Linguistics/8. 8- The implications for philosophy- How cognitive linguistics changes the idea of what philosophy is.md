### I. The Impact of Cognitive Linguistics on Philosophy
#### A. Challenging Traditional Notions of Truth and Reality

The study of cognitive linguistics has profound implications for philosophy, particularly in Anglo-American philosophy, which assumes that truth is based on the relationship between words and the external world. However, this assumption is false, as demonstrated by the existence of metaphorical truths, such as "he wasted an hour of my time," which are true only within a particular understanding of time as a resource.

The theory of truth requires that truth be based on understanding, which in turn relies on neural simulation and mental concepts. This challenges the correspondence theory of truth, which is central to Anglo-American philosophy. Furthermore, the study of cognitive linguistics reveals that many fundamental philosophical concepts, such as space, time, causation, morality, and being, are metaphorical and not objective features of the world.

For instance, causation is understood through various metaphors, including forces, purposes, and destinations, which vary across cultures and contexts. This understanding of causation as a complex, multifaceted concept challenges traditional philosophical accounts that posit a single, unitary cause. Similarly, morality is understood through metaphors such as moral accounting, which views moral actions as investments or expenditures.

These findings suggest that philosophy must be reevaluated in light of cognitive linguistics, and a new approach to understanding truth, meaning, and reality is needed.

#### B. The Role of Metaphor in Shaping Philosophical Concepts

The concept of morality is deeply rooted in metaphorical thinking, with various cultures employing distinct metaphors to understand and describe moral principles. One such metaphor is that of moral accounting, where well-being is equated with wealth, and harm done to others creates a debt that must be repaid through restitution, retribution, or revenge.

Another important metaphor is that of moral strength, which posits that individuals must be strong to stand up against evil. However, if one is morally weak, they are seen as potentially falling into immorality or becoming immoral themselves. This idea is often linked to the concept of moral authority, where certain individuals or groups are considered better equipped to determine what is right and wrong.

The metaphor of moral purity suggests that morality is akin to cleanliness, with immoral behavior being viewed as disgusting or unclean. In contrast, the metaphor of morality as health implies that immorality is a disease that can spread if not contained.

These metaphors have significant implications for how we understand and address moral issues in society.

#### C. Cultural Variations in Moral Metaphors

In American culture, two distinct family-based metaphors shape views on morality: the strict father model and the nurturant parent model. The former posits that children are born bad and require discipline to become good, while the latter suggests that children are inherently good and should be nurtured and protected.

These models have far-reaching implications for how we understand moral values such as empathy, responsibility, cooperation, trust, and honesty. The strict father model is often linked to a desire for authority and power over others, whereas the nurturant parent model emphasizes the importance of empathy and acting upon it.

This dichotomy highlights the complexities of human morality and the need for a nuanced understanding of moral concepts.

#### D. Implications for Philosophical Inquiry

The concept of morality is deeply rooted in human experience and embodied cognition, with various metaphors arising from fundamental aspects of human existence such as well-being, strength, health, and relationships.

These metaphors shape our understanding of moral principles and inform how we address moral issues in society. The study of cognitive linguistics reveals that many fundamental philosophical concepts are metaphorical and not objective features of the world.

This understanding has significant implications for philosophical inquiry, challenging traditional notions of mind and body, meaning and ideas, truth and understanding.

### II. Reevaluating the Foundations of Western Philosophy
#### A. The Concept of Essence in Philosophical Inquiry

The concept of essence has been central to philosophical inquiry since ancient times, with various philosophers attempting to define the nature of being. The Presocratics sought to identify the essence of being, with some proposing water, fire, or other elements as the fundamental substance.

However, these attempts ultimately led to the conclusion that the essence of being must be indeterminate and dynamic, reflecting the changing patterns of existence. Plato's philosophy introduced the idea that essences are abstract, ideal concepts that underlie physical reality, while Aristotle proposed that ideas are the actualizations of potentialities in the world.

#### B. The Evolution of Metaphors in Philosophical Inquiry

The concept of essence continued to evolve through the ages, with philosophers like Descartes and Kant developing new metaphors to describe the nature of being and knowledge. In modern times, analytic philosophy has relied heavily on metaphors such as thinking is seeing, thinking is manipulating objects, and thought is language to structure its understanding of mind and reality.

However, these metaphors have been largely overlooked or taken for granted, leading to a reevaluation of the foundations of Western philosophy. This reevaluation has given rise to new philosophical perspectives, including experientialism and embodied realism, which challenge traditional notions of mind and body, meaning and ideas, truth and understanding.

#### C. The Importance of Metaphor in Philosophical Inquiry

By examining the underlying metaphors that shape our understanding of these concepts, philosophers can gain a deeper insight into the nature of reality and knowledge itself. This reevaluation has significant implications for philosophical inquiry, challenging traditional notions of mind and body, meaning and ideas, truth and understanding.

The study of cognitive linguistics reveals that many fundamental philosophical concepts are metaphorical and not objective features of the world. This understanding has far-reaching implications for how we approach philosophical inquiry, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of metaphors and their role in shaping our understanding of reality.
