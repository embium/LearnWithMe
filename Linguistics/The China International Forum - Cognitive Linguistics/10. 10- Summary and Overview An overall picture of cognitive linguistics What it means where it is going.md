### I. The Evolution of Metaphor Theory
#### A. Early Stages: Descriptive Metaphors

The theory of metaphor has undergone significant development over time, reflecting the evolution of scientific theories themselves. Initially, metaphors were used to describe complex concepts by mapping one domain onto another. For instance, love was described as a journey, where lovers are travelers, relationships are vehicles, and difficulties are impediments. However, this approach proved inadequate for conceptual metaphors, as it couldn't create new structure or entities.

#### B. The Overhead Projector Metaphor

The introduction of the overhead projector metaphor allowed for the addition of structure and entities but still couldn't account for contradictions between domains. This limitation led to the development of more sophisticated theories that could better explain the nature of metaphors in scientific contexts.

#### C. The Neural Theory of Metaphor

A more recent theory, the neural theory of metaphor, proposes that primary metaphors are learned early through experience and their connections in the brain constitute the metaphor. This theory explains why structure is added to the target domain and how metaphorical reasoning can occur without creating new entities. The connection metaphor also accounts for contradictions between domains, where no connections are made if any part of the two domains are inconsistent.

### II. Metaphors in Physics
#### A. Einstein's Theory of General Relativity

In physics, metaphors have played a crucial role in understanding complex concepts. Einstein's theory of general relativity used the metaphor that time is a dimension of space and gravity is curvature in space-time. This metaphor allowed him to compute correctly using a single mathematics framework but postulates that there are no forces, only curvature.

#### B. String Theory

Similarly, string theory uses the metaphor that properties like spin and charge are spatial dimensions rather than objects possessed by particles. This shift allows for the use of Riemannian geometry, which can be curved, making all forces equivalent to curvature. However, this literal interpretation is problematic as it suggests that everything in the universe, including humans, is just geometry.

#### C. The Information Theory Metaphor

The information theory metaphor for physics proposes that everything in the universe is information rather than geometry or objects. This metaphor has been shown to be equivalent to other theories but its literal interpretation is also questionable as it implies that humans and forces are merely information.

### III. Metaphors in Mathematics
#### A. Understanding Infinity

In mathematics, metaphors have been used to understand complex concepts like infinity. The formula e^(iÏ€+1)=0 requires multiple metaphors from different branches of mathematics to understand its meaning. Actual infinity has been found to be metaphorical, requiring everyday finite processes to comprehend it.

#### B. A Single General Metaphor for Infinity

A single general metaphor for actual infinity exists, with each type being a special case. This understanding highlights the inherent subjectivity and dependence on human thought processes in mathematics.

### IV. Implications of Metaphor Theory
#### A. The Subjectivity of Scientific Knowledge

The theory of metaphor provides a framework for understanding complex concepts in science and mathematics. By recognizing the role of metaphors in these fields, we can better appreciate the nature of scientific knowledge and its limitations. Mathematics is often thought to be an objective, universal truth existing independently of human minds.

#### B. The Embodied Nature of Thought

The study of cognitive linguistics reveals that all thought, including mathematical concepts, arises from the neural system and bodily experiences. The theory of conceptual metaphors shows how abstract concepts like causation and time are grounded in physical experiences and embodied in the brain's neural structures.

#### C. Challenges to Traditional Views

The discovery of multiple logics of causation challenges the traditional view of a single, objective logic of causation. Similarly, the rational actor model assumes a single, universal form of rationality, which is later revealed to be metaphorical and dependent on specific cultural and historical contexts.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. The Importance of Understanding Metaphors

These findings suggest that mathematics, language, and science are not objective truths but rather products of human thought processes, shaped by our bodily experiences and neural structures. This perspective has profound implications for philosophy, highlighting the importance of understanding and simulation in grasping truth.

#### B. New Foundations for Philosophy

The study of cognitive linguistics provides a new foundation for philosophy, one that emphasizes embodiment, metaphorical thinking, and the role of imagination in understanding the world. By embracing cognitive science as a central discipline in the university, we can foster a deeper understanding of human thought and language, leading to new discoveries and applications in various fields.

#### C. The Role of Metaphors in Decision-Making

The importance of understanding metaphors lies in their ability to reveal the underlying assumptions and values that guide decision-making. Cognitive linguistics teaches us that metaphor is not just a figure of speech but a fundamental aspect of human thought and language, and studying it can help us understand our own culture and society better.

#### D. The Interconnectedness of Human Thought

By comparing different conceptual systems around the world, we can gain respect for the human mind's diversity and similarities, which is essential for living together in one world. The study of language acquisition has also shown that grammar is embodied in childhood experiences, limiting the possibilities for basic constructions worldwide.

#### E. A New Era for Interdisciplinary Research

As linguistics becomes increasingly intertwined with neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and other disciplines, it's essential to recognize that language affects everything and is affected by everything else. By embracing cognitive science as a central discipline in the university, we can foster a deeper understanding of human thought and language, leading to new discoveries and applications in various fields.
