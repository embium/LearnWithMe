### I. Understanding Metaphors in Human Experience
#### A. The Concept of Primary Metaphors

The concept of primary metaphors is crucial for understanding various aspects of human experience. Primary metaphors are fundamental, universal concepts that underlie many other metaphors and shape our perception of the world. They are not just simple ideas but complex frameworks that influence how we think about time, events, purpose, and even ourselves.

- **Time as a Resource**: One common primary metaphor is viewing time as a resource like money. This concept implies that time is something valuable that can be spent or wasted. However, this metaphor is not universal; some cultures see time as flowing naturally without the need to budget or manage it.
  
#### B. Complex Metaphors and Their Variations

Complex metaphors are built upon primary metaphors and encompass a wide range of human experiences. They include metaphors for events, purpose, states, causes, and more.

- **Event Structure Metaphor**: The event structure metaphor is universal and underlies various aspects of human experience. It views states as locations, changes as movements between these locations, causes as forces exerting pressure or motion, and achieving a purpose as reaching a destination.
  
#### C. Duality in the Event Structure Metaphor

The event structure metaphor has a dual version where states are seen as properties or possessions rather than locations. This duality allows for a deeper understanding of how humans think about their experiences and the world around them.

- **Understanding Human Thought**: The mind is also understood through metaphorical frameworks, with thinking being a bodily action of some sort, ideas being the things acted upon, and reasoning being a movement from one idea to another. This complex system of metaphors underlies human thought and language.
  
#### D. Metaphors in Communication

The concept of thought and communication can be understood through various metaphors that shape our understanding of these complex processes.

- **Conduit Metaphor**: The conduit metaphor views communication as sending an object (an idea) in a container (language) to another person. However, cognitive linguistics reveals that meaning arises from the interaction of metaphors, image schemas, and prepositions.
  
#### E. Poetic Metaphors

Poetic metaphors often extend and combine conventional metaphors in creative ways.

- **Combining Metaphors**: For example, Shakespeare's sonnet 73 uses multiple metaphors to convey the theme of death without directly stating it. The poem employs metaphors such as a life time being a year, day, or fire, with each stage having its own characteristics.
  
#### F. Challenges to Analytic Philosophy

The mind is often compared to a machine, where thoughts are products and thinking is an automated process. However, cognitive linguistics reveals that meaning arises from the interaction of metaphors, image schemas, and prepositions, challenging the notion that language works in a straightforward, non-metaphorical way.

- **Complexity of English Prepositions**: The meanings of words like "overlook" or "oversight" arise from the combination of metaphors for looking, seeing, and covering. This complexity is another area where metaphor plays a crucial role.
  
#### G. Metaphors in Understanding Life and Death

The concepts of life and death can be understood through various metaphors.

- **Opposing Forces**: Life is often associated with light, warmth, and intensity, while death is characterized by darkness, coldness, and a decrease in vitality. These opposing forces are reflected in the cycles of nature.
  
#### H. Conclusion

By employing primary metaphors and building upon them, poets like Shakespeare craft works that resonate with readers on multiple levels, inviting us to engage with their ideas and reflect on our own experiences.
