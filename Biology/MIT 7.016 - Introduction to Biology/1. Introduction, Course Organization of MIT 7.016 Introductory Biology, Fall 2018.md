* Tips for navigating the course material

This foundation will ensure a smooth transition into the more in-depth topics that follow.

### II. The Evolution of Biology
#### A. From Taxonomy to Molecular Science

Our journey through biology begins with a fast-paced tour of molecules to man, highlighting breakthroughs in DNA structure and its impact on modern biology. You'll see how the study of biology has evolved from:

* **Taxonomy** (the classification of living organisms)
* **Dissection** (studying anatomy through physical examination)
to
* A molecular science that integrates technology, engineering, and science

### III. Fundamental Principles in Biology
#### A. Common Threads Across All Living Organisms

As we explore the world of biology, you'll gain an understanding of fundamental principles common across all living organisms, including:

* **Systems biology** (studying complex biological systems)
* **Synthetic biology** (designing and constructing new biological systems)
* The integration of technology and engineering in modern biology

### IV. Understanding Health and Disease
#### A. Ethical Implications of New Scientific Discoveries

Our journey will take us from the prebiotic world to the evolution of cells, multicellular life, and eventually, Homo sapiens. We'll examine:

* **The human genome project** (the mapping of the human genetic code)
* The elucidation of DNA structure
* Technological advancements that enable genome sequencing and understanding genetic variation

### V. Cellular Dynamics
#### A. Cell Size, Complexity, and Imaging

As we delve into cellular processes, you'll learn about:

* **Cell size and complexity**
* The role of imaging and visualization in understanding cellular behavior
* The importance of cell division control and its implications for cancer progression

### VI. Foundational Concepts
#### A. Building Blocks for Understanding Cellular Dynamics

In the first half of the course, we will cover foundational concepts such as:

* **Biochemistry** (the chemical processes that occur within living organisms)
* **Genetics** (the study of heredity and genetic variation)
* **Cell signaling** (the communication between cells)

These concepts will provide a basis for understanding more complex cellular dynamics and prepare you for the in-depth exploration of biology that follows.
