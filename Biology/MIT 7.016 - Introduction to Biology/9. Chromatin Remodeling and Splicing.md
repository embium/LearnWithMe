### I. Transcription Control
#### A. Importance of Transcription Control

Transcription control is crucial because knowing how to transcribe and how transcription is controlled allows us to understand which messenger RNA (mRNA) is sent out for translation into protein. This understanding is essential for various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation.

#### B. Determining the Copied Strand of DNA
- To determine which strand of DNA is copied during transcription, we read from 3' to 5' and make the transcript in the opposite direction.
- The start site of transcription is also important information, as it specifies where transcription begins on the double-stranded DNA.

#### C. Transcription Factors and Regulation

Transcription factors regulate whether transcription occurs by binding to specific sites on the DNA, such as promoters and enhancers. These regions can be located near the start site of transcription or at a distance from it.
- Transcription factors can activate or repress transcription, depending on the situation.
- Chromatin remodelers are also important for transcriptional control, as they help to unwind chromatin and make it accessible for transcription machinery to bind.

#### D. Histone Modifications and DNA Methylation

Histone modifications, such as acetylation, can neutralize the positive charge of histones and allow DNA to be unwound, while DNA methylation stabilizes chromatin and represses transcription.
- Other transformations that occur in the nucleus include 5' capping, which protects the 5' end of the transcript from exonuclease activity, and polyadenylation, which adds a long tail of adenine nucleotides to the 3' end of the transcript.

#### E. Splicing and Gene Expression

Splicing occurs in eukaryotes, where introns are removed from the pre-messenger RNA and exons are joined together to form the mature messenger RNA.
- Splicing is important because it allows us to remove non-coding regions of DNA and focus on the coding regions that will become proteins.
- The number of genes that encode proteins is relatively small, with about 20,000 genes in humans, which makes splicing a crucial step in gene expression.

### II. Protein Synthesis
#### A. Overview of Protein Synthesis

The process of protein synthesis involves a complex interplay between various molecular players, including messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), amino acids, and ribosomes.
- The mRNA molecule is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus and then undergoes splicing to create a mature transcript that can be translated into protein.

#### B. Translation Process

The translation process introduces a huge amount of diversity into the transcripts, as different splicing events can result in new proteins being encoded.
- In fact, the number of possible proteins that can be produced is estimated to be much higher than 20,000, due to the various ways in which tRNAs and amino acids can be combined during translation.

#### C. Role of Ribosomes

The ribosome, a complex organelle composed of nucleic acid and protein, plays a crucial role in assembling the new protein strand by reading the mRNA sequence and matching it with the corresponding amino acids brought in by tRNAs.
- This process is highly regulated and involves various landmarks, including the structure of the ribosome.

#### D. Role of tRNA Molecules

The tRNA molecules, often referred to as decoders, are essential for translating the nucleic acid code into a protein sequence, with their anticodon loops recognizing specific codons on the mRNA and prescribing what amino acids get put in place.
- This intricate process has been extensively studied, allowing researchers to manipulate it and even hijack protein translation by introducing non-standard amino acids.
