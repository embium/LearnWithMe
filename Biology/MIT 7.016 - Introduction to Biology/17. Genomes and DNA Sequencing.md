### I. Sequencing and Disease Gene Identification
#### A. Introduction to Sequencing and Its Applications

Sequencing the genome has revolutionized the field of genetics by enabling researchers to identify genes responsible for diseases more efficiently. By knowing the sequence of the genome, scientists can rapidly identify similar genes through sequence homology, leading to more direct approaches in finding disease-causing genes.

#### B. Traditional Methods of Gene Identification
- **Functional Complementation**: This method involves cloning fragments of DNA into plasmids and identifying the one that rescues a defect in a mutant.
  - However, this process can be time-consuming due to the need to create a DNA library.
- **PCR Amplification with Specific Primers**: With knowledge of the genome sequence, specific primers can be designed to amplify the gene of interest using PCR, allowing for more targeted approaches.
- **Restriction Enzyme Analysis**: Restriction enzymes can also be used to cut and identify specific genes. However, this method has limitations in terms of specificity and accuracy.

#### C. Establishing Linkage Between Disease Alleles and Molecular Markers
The goal is to establish linkage between a disease allele and a molecular marker, which can be achieved through various types of polymorphisms.
- **Microsatellites**: These are short, repeated sequences of DNA that can be used as markers for genetic studies.
- **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)**: SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide at a given position in the genome and can be used to identify specific genes responsible for diseases.

#### D. DNA Sequencing Technologies
DNA sequencing is necessary to detect SNPs, and various technologies have been developed over time.
- **Sanger Sequencing**: This older method involves using DNA polymerase to stop at specific nucleotides, allowing for the determination of the sequence of a DNA fragment.
  - However, this process has limitations in terms of accuracy and speed due to its reliance on chain termination sequencing.

#### E. Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies
These newer methods involve attaching template DNA to a solid substrate and labeling each of the four nucleoside triphosphates with a dye that prevents elongation when incorporated into the growing strand.
- **Chain Termination Sequencing**: This method was used for many years before being replaced by next-generation sequencing technologies.
  - It involves spiking reactions with different dye-deoxy nucleotides to create distinct banding patterns reflecting the sequence of the template DNA.

#### F. Modern Sequencing Approaches
Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the field by enabling rapid and efficient sequencing of large datasets.
- **Parallel Sequencing**: This process can be performed in parallel on multiple strands, allowing for rapid and efficient sequencing of large datasets.
  - The sequence of fluorescence emitted as the polymerase incorporates each nucleotide is then read out to determine the DNA sequence.
