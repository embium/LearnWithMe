### I. Understanding Cancer: A Progressive Deregulation of Normal Cell Behavior
#### A. The Role of Genes in Cancer Development

Cancer can be defined as a progressive deregulation of normal cell behavior, resulting from mutations that occur in the cell. This deregulation leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of cells, which is characteristic of cancer. There are three main classes of genes involved in cancer: oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and caretaker genes.

*   **Oncogenes**: These genes promote growth and survival when mutated. They can become activated due to mutations or gene amplification, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.
*   **Tumor Suppressor Genes**: These genes inhibit growth or promote death. When these genes are lost or inactivated, cells may grow uncontrollably, leading to cancer.
*   **Caretaker Genes**: These genes maintain genomic integrity by mediating DNA repair and ensuring genome stability. A loss of function in these genes can lead to cancer.

Examples of tumor suppressor genes include the RB gene, which is associated with retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. The disease has two forms: sporadic, which arises without family history and is usually unilateral, and familial, which runs in families and is often bilateral. Individuals with the familial form have an increased risk of getting other tumors in their body later in life.

#### B. Mechanisms of Cancer Development

The inheritance pattern for retinoblastoma appears to be autosomal dominant at the organismal level, but it's actually a predisposition that requires only one mutant allele to manifest as disease. This predisposition is due to heterozygosity, where all somatic cells have one functional and one mutant copy of the RB gene, making them one mutation away from losing both copies.

The loss of heterozygosity can occur through various mechanisms, including:

*   **Point Mutations**: Changes in a single nucleotide that can lead to a change in the amino acid sequence or disrupt the function of the protein.
*   **Chromosome Loss**: The loss of an entire chromosome, which can result in the loss of tumor suppressor genes and the gain of oncogenes.
*   **DNA Damage**: Damage to the DNA molecule that can lead to mutations and cancer development.
*   **Deletions**: The removal of a segment of DNA that can disrupt the function of tumor suppressor genes.
*   **Translocations**: The movement of a segment of DNA from one chromosome to another, which can result in the fusion of oncogenes or the loss of tumor suppressors.
*   **Epigenetic Changes**: Changes in gene expression that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence itself. For example, promoter methylation can silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes.

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for grasping how cancer develops at the tissue level, as exemplified by colon cancer, where a tumor forms in the stem cell niche of the crypts.

#### C. Key Steps in Cancer Development

The development of cancer involves several key steps, including:

*   **Accumulation of Mutations**: The accumulation of mutations or loss of tumor suppressors that can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and survival.
*   **Disruption of Tissue Homeostasis**: The disruption of the normal balance between cell proliferation and death, leading to the formation of tumors.

In colon cancer, this process begins with the dysregulation of signaling pathways that control cell movement and tissue homeostasis. The Wnt signaling pathway is particularly important in this context, as its dysregulation can lead to the formation of polyps, which are benign growths that can eventually become malignant.

A key tumor suppressor involved in this process is the APC gene, which normally inhibits beta-catenin and prevents constitutive activation of Wnt signaling. However, mutations or loss of the APC gene can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and accumulation of further mutations, ultimately resulting in cancer.

#### D. Targeted Treatments for Cancer

Targeted treatments for cancer have been developed by identifying specific molecular mechanisms driving the disease and designing small molecules to inhibit these pathways. For example, Gleevec has been used to target the BCR-ABL fusion protein that is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
