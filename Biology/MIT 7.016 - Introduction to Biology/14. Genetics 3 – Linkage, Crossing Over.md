### I. Mendelian Inheritance and Sex-Linked Traits
#### A. Introduction to the White Gene in Fruit Flies

The lecture began by continuing the discussion from the previous session on Mendelian inheritance, focusing on the fruit fly and the white gene. The instructor asked students to consider the reciprocal cross of white-eyed females with red-eyed males. This cross is significant because it involves a sex-linked trait, where the genotype of the white-eyed females is homozygous recessive for the white mutant allele.

#### B. Genotype and Phenotype in the F1 Generation

The dominant phenotype in fruit flies is red eyes due to the enzyme encoded by the gene responsible for pigment production. The instructor explained that the F1 generation would have a different combination of alleles than the parents, with all males having white eyes and females being heterozygous but having a functional copy of the gene that produces the red pigment.

#### C. Comparison with Mendel's Crosses

The discussion on the fruit fly cross led to a comparison with Mendel's crosses, highlighting the difference between autosomal traits (inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner) and sex-linked traits. This distinction is crucial for understanding the inheritance patterns of certain genes.

### II. Research on ALS Disease
#### A. 3D Modeling and Cell-Based Research

The instructor mentioned research in the mechanical engineering department at MIT, which has designed a 3D model for ALS disease using cells from patients with ALS or normal individuals. This research relates to the x-linked dominant form of ALS, which has an inheritance pattern similar to the white mutant in fruit flies.

### III. Test Crosses and Linkage
#### A. Introduction to Test Crosses

The lecture then moved on to discuss test crosses, a technique used to determine the genotype of an individual with unknown alleles. The instructor explained that test crosses involve crossing an individual with known genotypes to determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring.

#### B. Concept of Linkage

The concept of linkage was introduced, where two genes are physically near each other on a chromosome, making it more likely for them to be inherited together. The instructor explained that recombination frequency can be used to measure distances between genes and generate a map.

### IV. Recombination Frequencies and Genetic Maps
#### A. Alfred Sturtevant's Work

The instructor mentioned Alfred Sturtevant's work in 1911, where he first constructed a genetic map using recombination frequencies. This pioneering work laid the foundation for understanding gene linkage and physical structures on chromosomes.

#### B. Three-Point Crosses and Genetic Mapping

A three-point cross was discussed, where three genes are hybridized, and the progeny were analyzed to determine the distances between the genes. The instructor provided data from a cross with three such genes and explained how to calculate the distances between them using recombination frequencies.

#### C. Constructing a Genetic Map

The final map showed that the two genes farthest apart are A and B, while D is closer to B than it is to A. However, when adding up the distances between B and D and D and A, a discrepancy was found, suggesting that the distance between B and D might be underestimated due to double crossovers in this region.

### V. Double Crossovers and Genetic Recombination
#### A. Importance of Considering Double Crossovers

When analyzing genetic recombination, it's essential to consider the frequency and types of crossovers that occur between genes. Double crossover events can lead to an underestimate of actual recombination frequencies, as multiple crossovers may be missed.

#### B. Studying Gene Linkage in Yeast

To better understand these phenomena, researchers often use yeast, which can exist in both haploid and diploid forms, allowing for the study of meiosis and its products. By examining the spores produced by yeast undergoing meiosis, scientists can observe the direct result of a single mitotic division and gain insights into gene linkage and physical structures on chromosomes.

#### C. Types of Spores and Gene Linkage

The alignment of chromosomes during meiosis can produce different types of spores, including parental die type (where all spores are either dominant or recessive for both genes) and non-parental die type (where the spores have mixed genotypes). However, if a gene is unlinked to the centromere, recombination events between the gene and the centromere can occur, resulting in tetra types (four different spore genotypes).

#### D. Ratio of Spore Types and Gene Linkage

The ratio of parental die type, non-parental die type, and tetra type spores can provide valuable information about gene linkage and physical structures on chromosomes.
