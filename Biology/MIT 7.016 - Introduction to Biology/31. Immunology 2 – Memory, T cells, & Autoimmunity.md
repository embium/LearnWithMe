### I. The Immune System's Response to Infections
#### A. Antigen Presentation and Recognition

The immune system has a complex mechanism to address infections, particularly those caused by intracellular pathogens like Listeria. This involves antigen presentation, where peptides are displayed on the surface of cells for immune cells to recognize. **Antigen presentation** is a crucial step in initiating an immune response.

- **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)** plays a vital role in this process. Class 1 MHC molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and display peptides from the cytoplasm, while class 2 MHC molecules are restricted to antigen-presenting cells like B cells and display peptides from the extracellular space.
- The **T-cell receptor (TCR)** recognizes antigens through its variable domain. The diversity of TCRs is generated by recombination at the genomic locus.

#### B. T-Cell Responses

CD8 positive T cells, or killer T cells, recognize class 1 MHC molecules and kill infected cells, while CD4 positive T cells, or helper T cells, enhance B cell function by inducing affinity maturation, isotype switching, and promoting differentiation into memory B cells.

#### C. Immune System's Balance Between Tolerance and Response

The immune system must balance tolerance of self-antigens with the ability to attack foreign pathogens, a delicate balance that can lead to autoimmune diseases if disrupted. The immune system has to distinguish between self and foreign proteins, and its response should be different for each.

#### D. Autoimmune Diseases and Immune System Mechanisms

Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks self-proteins, leading to conditions like myasthenia gravis, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. To prevent autoimmunity, the immune system employs mechanisms such as:

- **Negative selection**, where cells that recognize self-proteins are deleted or inactivated.
- The activation of **innate immunity**, which helps distinguish between self and foreign antigens.
- Inhibitory receptors on T-cells, like **CTLA-4** and **PD-1**, help keep the immune system in check by preventing excessive activation.

#### E. Complexity and Delicacy of Immune System's Self-Foreign Distinction Process

The discovery that blocking these inhibitory receptors can enhance the immune response against cancer cells led to a Nobel Prize-winning therapy for advanced cancer. However, this treatment also carries the risk of inducing autoimmunity as a side effect, highlighting the complexity and delicacy of the immune system's self-foreign distinction process.
