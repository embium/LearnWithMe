### I. Introduction to Fluorescence in Biology
#### A. Definition and Principles of Fluorescence

Fluorescence is a crucial tool in biology that allows us to study cellular activity and visualize biological processes. Unlike luminescence, which can be caused by burning flames or other heat-related phenomena, fluorescence involves the emission of light not associated with heat. This process occurs when a molecule absorbs light energy, causing it to emit light at a longer wavelength.

The key principle in fluorescence is that higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths, while lower energy corresponds to longer wavelengths. For example, when a molecule absorbs blue light (shorter wavelength), it can emit red light (longer wavelength) as it returns to its ground state. This process involves the excitation of a molecule with light of one energy, followed by its return to a ground state, emitting light at a lower energy and longer wavelength.

#### B. Types of Fluorescent Dyes

Fluorescent dyes, such as ethidium bromide, can be used to visualize DNA. However, they must be carefully chosen due to their potential toxicity. Newer dyes, like DAPI and Hoechst, have been developed that bind to DNA in a non-toxic manner, allowing for the visualization of nucleic acids within cells. These dyes can also be used to track cell division and monitor other biological processes.

Some examples of fluorescent dyes include:

* Ethidium bromide: A classic dye used to visualize DNA, but with potential toxicity concerns.
* DAPI (4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole): A non-toxic dye that binds to DNA and is commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.
* Hoechst 33342: Another non-toxic dye that binds to DNA and is often used in combination with other fluorescent dyes.

#### C. Applications of Fluorescent Dyes

Fluorescent dyes have a wide range of applications in biology, including:

* Visualizing cells by labeling specific structures or proteins.
* Tracking cell division and monitoring biological processes.
* Studying cellular activity and behavior.
* Analyzing the structure and function of biomolecules.

### II. Introduction to Antibodies
#### A. Definition and Structure of Antibodies

Antibodies are large, complex molecules that serve as agents of the human adaptive immune system. They can be exploited to study biology by recognizing specific targets, such as proteins or carbohydrates, and signaling their presence through fluorescence. The technological side of antibodies will be explored further in subsequent lectures.

Antibodies have a stable quaternary structure composed of polypeptide chains, with most of their structure remaining constant while a variable section adapts to bind specific targets as B cells mature. This variability allows antibodies to recognize and bind to virtually any target antigen.

#### B. Types of Antibodies

There are two main types of antibodies: polyclonal and monoclonal.

* Polyclonal antibodies: These antibodies are generated by the immune system in response to a specific antigen and can recognize multiple epitopes.
* Monoclonal antibodies: These antibodies are generated through an engineering method where spleen cells are fused with myeloma cells, producing hybridomas that produce very specifically just monoclonal antibodies.

#### C. Applications of Antibodies

Antibodies have a wide range of applications in biology, including:

* Visualizing cells by labeling specific structures or proteins.
* Tracking cell division and monitoring biological processes.
* Studying cellular activity and behavior.
* Analyzing the structure and function of biomolecules.

However, one limitation of using antibodies is that they cannot cross the plasma membrane to get into living cells, so cells must be fixed and made permeable for antibody reagents to work effectively.
