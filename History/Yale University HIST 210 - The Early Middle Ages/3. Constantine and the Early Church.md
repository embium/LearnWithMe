### I. The Conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity
#### A. Background and Context

The conversion of Roman Emperor Constantine to Christianity marked a pivotal moment in the history of the Roman Empire. Despite being illegal for over 250 years, Christianity had been growing in influence, but its acceptance was still a long way off. The polytheistic nature of Roman religion and the fact that Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, had been put to death by the Roman Empire made it seem like an unlikely candidate for official recognition.

#### B. The Vision or Dream Before the Battle of Milvian Bridge

Constantine's conversion is often attributed to a vision or dream he experienced before the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312. This event was significant, as it marked a turning point in Constantine's life and ultimately led to his conversion to Christianity. While the details of this vision are not well-documented, it is clear that it had a profound impact on Constantine, leading him to re-evaluate his relationship with the Christian faith.

#### C. The Edict of Tolerance

The conversion of Constantine was followed by the Edict of Tolerance, which legalized Christianity and marked its acceptance as a tolerated religion within the Empire. This edict was significant, as it represented a major shift in the Roman Empire's attitude towards Christianity. Despite initial reservations, the Edict of Tolerance paved the way for Christianity to become an integral part of Roman society.

#### D. Constantine's Favor Towards the Church

Over time, Constantine's favor towards the Church grew, with him returning confiscated property, exempting the Church from state taxation, and allowing church officials to use the imperial communications system. He also built two great basilicas on the outskirts of Rome, one of which was Saint Peter's Basilica. These actions demonstrate the significant role that Christianity played in Constantine's life and the impact it had on his policies as Emperor.

### II. The Impact of Constantine's Conversion on the Church
#### A. The Spread of Christianity

By the time of Constantine's death in 337, perhaps as much as half of the Empire had embraced Christianity. This marked a significant shift in the demographics of the Roman Empire and had far-reaching implications for the Church.

#### B. The Relationship Between Church and State

Constantine's conversion raised questions about the impact of his actions on the relationship between church and state. As Emperor, Constantine was both the head of the state and the patron of the Church. This created a complex dynamic, where the lines between secular rule and spiritual authority were blurred.

#### C. Theological Controversies

Constantine's increasing devotion to Christianity also led him to become more involved in theological controversies within the Church. He presided over the first ecumenical council of bishops at Nicaea in the 320s, which marked a significant moment in the development of Christian doctrine. However, his efforts to resolve these disputes ultimately failed, highlighting the difficulties of an emperor trying to impose his will on the Church.

### III. The Legacy of Constantine's Conversion
#### A. The Division Between Eastern and Western Roman Empires

The relocation of the capital to Constantinople, a new city built by Constantine on the site of Byzantium, marked a permanent division between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. This event would eventually become permanent, with significant implications for the future of the Roman Empire.

#### B. The Blurring of Lines Between Church and State

Constantine's conversion also marked a shift in the relationship between church and state. As head of the Church, Constantine was deferred to by bishops but not himself a bishop, highlighting the complexities of early Christian leadership. His favoritism towards the Church led to increased taxation, with the burden falling on non-clergy citizens.

#### C. The Preservation of Civilization

Constantine's reign marked the beginning of an era where the Church played a significant role in preserving civilization. Despite the collapse of the Western Empire in 476, the Church would ultimately contribute to its preservation, highlighting the enduring legacy of Constantine's conversion.
