### I. The Post-Roman Period in Ireland and England: A Tale of Two Conversion Processes

#### A. Background and Overview

The 5th to 7th centuries AD were transformative periods for both Ireland and England, marked by significant events that shaped their histories, cultures, and religious landscapes. While the Roman Empire's influence had a profound impact on England, leaving behind a rich legacy of archaeological sites and written records, Ireland remained untouched by Roman occupation. This difference in historical context led to distinct conversion processes to Christianity, with far-reaching consequences for both regions.

#### B. The Conversion of Ireland

- **St. Patrick and the Irish Mission**: In the 5th century AD, St. Patrick, a British missionary, converted Ireland to Christianity. This marked the first place outside the Roman world to be Christianized.
- **Irish Monasticism**: Characterized by austere asceticism and a decentralized, rural background, Irish monasteries were ruled by monks who often held authority over bishops.
- **Unique Conversion Process**: Unlike England, Ireland's conversion was not influenced by Roman occupation or the Anglo-Saxon invasions. This led to a distinct form of Christianity that would later interact with the Roman church.

#### C. The Conversion of England

- **Augustine's Mission (597 AD)**: The conversion of England began with Augustine's mission from Rome, marking the start of a complex process involving two types of Christianity.
- **The Irish or Celtic Church**: This decentralized, more wandering church celebrated Easter according to a different calendar than the Roman church, leading to competition and controversy over the holiday's calculation.
- **The Senate of Whitby (664 AD)**: The decision at this council marked a turning point, as it led to the adoption of the Roman calculation for Easter and the establishment of bishops, hierarchy, and a more organized church.

#### D. The Anglo-Saxon Period in England

- **Archaeological Evidence**: Finds like the Sutton Hoo treasure reflect the world of treasure accumulation, drinking halls, and palaces, highlighting the complexities of England's conversion to Christianity.
- **Interplay between Christianity and Paganism**: The early medieval period in England was marked by a complex interplay between these two forces, with the Irish or Celtic church playing a significant role.

#### E. Consequences of the Roman Calculation

- **Establishment of Bishoprics and Monasteries**: The adoption of the Roman form of Christianity led to the establishment of bishoprics, monasteries, and the preservation of cosmopolitan Roman culture.
- **Rapid Cultural Accomplishment and Integration**: This period saw rapid cultural accomplishment and integration, as exemplified by Syrian popes and the creation of magnificent manuscripts like the Codex Amiatinus.

#### F. Conclusion

The post-Roman period in Ireland and England was marked by significant differences due to varying levels of Roman influence and archaeological evidence. The unique conversion processes in both regions had far-reaching consequences for their histories, cultures, and religious landscapes. Understanding these events provides valuable context for appreciating the complexities of medieval Europe and the development of Christianity in different parts of the continent.
