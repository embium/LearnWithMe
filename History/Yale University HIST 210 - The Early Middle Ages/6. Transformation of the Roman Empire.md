### I. The Transformation of the Roman Empire (410-480 CE)

#### A. Overview of the Western Roman Empire's Collapse

The transformation of the Roman Empire from 410 to 480 CE was a gradual process marked by the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire and its eventual collapse into barbarian kingdoms. This period saw the empire being dismembered by various barbarian groups who sought to be part of the empire, share in its wealth, and continue its institutions.

#### B. The Role of Barbarian Groups

- **Barbarian groups** were not necessarily intent on destruction but rather sought to integrate into Roman society.
- These groups admired Rome's institutions and wanted to continue them.
- Examples include the Visigoths, who eventually took over Italy in 493 CE, and the Ostrogoths, who established a kingdom in Italy.

#### C. The Impact of Internal Disorders

The Roman army became invisible during this period, suggesting that internal disorders rather than external pressures contributed to the empire's collapse.
- **Internal disorders** refer to the decline of the Roman military, administrative systems, and economic stability.
- This led to a power vacuum that was filled by barbarian groups.

#### D. The Huns and External Threats

The Huns, a nomadic people known for their brutality, threatened the Eastern Empire but were eventually defeated by an alliance of Visigoths and Romans.
- **Hunnic invasions** posed a significant external threat to the empire, but they were ultimately repelled.

#### E. The Roman Elite's Accommodation

The Roman elite accommodated themselves to their new barbarian rulers through negotiation and compromise.
- Examples include wealthy Roman bishops like Sidonius Apollinaris negotiating with Visigothic kings.
- This accommodation allowed for a relatively peaceful transition from Roman rule to barbarian kingdoms.

#### F. The Decline of the Roman Empire

The transformation of the Roman Empire was a complex process marked by gradual changes over time, rather than a sudden cataclysmic event.
- **Decline of the Roman Empire** refers to the gradual disintegration of the Western Roman Empire and its eventual collapse into barbarian kingdoms.

#### G. The Impact on Rome's Population

The decline of the Roman Empire had significant demographic consequences for Rome itself.
- By 590 AD, there were likely no more than 150,000 people living in Rome, down from an estimated 800,000 at its peak in 5 BC.
- **Radical material simplification** in ceramics, building materials, and luxury goods reflects a shift towards a more rural and agricultural society.

#### H. The Role of the Church

The Church played a significant role in preserving classical civilization but was not immune to the decline of learning and culture.
- By the time Charlemagne was crowned Roman Emperor in 800 AD, Rome's population had dwindled to around 30,000 people, with many living in makeshift conditions within the city's ancient walls.

#### I. Conclusion

The transformation of the Roman Empire from 410 to 480 CE was a complex process marked by gradual changes over time.
- **Key takeaways** include:
    - The collapse of the Western Roman Empire led to the establishment of barbarian kingdoms and the eventual takeover of Italy by the Ostrogoths in 493 CE.
    - The decline of the Roman Empire was a gradual process that began with the Vandal control of North Africa, which severed the city's wheat supply and led to a significant decrease in population.
