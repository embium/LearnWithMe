### I. The Islamic Conquests: A Historical Overview
#### A. Background and Motivations

The Islamic conquests took place from the 7th to the 8th century, marking a significant expansion of Arab power and influence across vast territories. While driven in part by religious motivation, these conquests did not involve a desire to convert the world to Islam. Instead, they were characterized by a rapid expansion of Arab control that eventually extended from Spain to India.

#### B. Key Factors Contributing to the Conquests

- **Weakness of Persia and Byzantium**: The decline of these empires created an opportunity for the Arabs to expand their territories.
- **Mastering Desert Warfare**: The Arabs' expertise in desert warfare allowed them to navigate and conquer vast, arid regions.
- **Discontent among Religious Minorities**: Disenfranchised religious minorities within the conquered territories often welcomed Arab rule as a means of escaping persecution or gaining greater freedoms.
- **Policy of Tolerance**: The Arabs were generally tolerant of other religions, allowing Christians and Jews to maintain their faiths and pay taxes at rates similar to those under previous empires.

#### C. Internal Division Within Islam

The internal division within Islam from 650 AD led to the emergence of Sunni and Shiite factions, a split that continues to define many Islamic countries today. This division was rooted in the succession crisis following Mohammed's death, with Abu Bakr being elected caliph but not recognized by some tribes.

#### D. The Ridda Wars

The ridda or apostasy wars were fought over the legitimacy of Abu Bakr as the first caliph after Mohammed's death. These conflicts led to further divisions within Islam and set the stage for future power struggles.

### II. The Emergence of Sunni and Shiite Factions
#### A. The Umayyad Dynasty

The civil war between 656 and 661 culminated in the establishment of the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled until 750. This period saw significant expansion under the leadership of various caliphs.

#### B. Shiism: Origins and Beliefs

- **Rejection of the Caliph**: The Shiites rejected the caliph as a religious figure, citing illegitimacy and dynastic questions.
- **Informal Government**: Shiites preferred a more informal government based on the consensus of the umma or community of the faithful.
- **Imam and Messianic Expectations**: In Shiism, there is an emphasis on the imam as a leader who is inspired rather than merely an administrator. This often leads to apocalyptic thinking and prophecy about a future savior.

#### C. Apocalyptic Thinking in Shiism

Apocalyptic thinking and prophecy are deeply ingrained in Shiism, particularly concerning the twelfth imam who has gone into hiding and will return to exact revenge on those who have wronged them. This belief system attracts discontented people within Islam, especially non-Arab Muslims who feel marginalized by the Arab-dominated Caliphate.

#### D. Proto-Shiite Movements

As the Islamic world expands, tensions between Arab and non-Arab Muslims grow, leading to proto-Shiite movements or recruiting grounds for Shiism. Despite efforts to suppress prophecy, it remains a constant presence in Islam, with significant consequences that will be explored further in subsequent lectures.

### III. Conclusion
The Islamic conquests were driven by a combination of factors, including the weakness of Persia and Byzantium, mastery of desert warfare, discontent among religious minorities, and a policy of tolerance towards other religions. Despite internal divisions within Islam, these conquests continued to expand Arab influence across vast territories. The emergence of Sunni and Shiite factions was rooted in the succession crisis following Mohammed's death, with Shiism emphasizing apocalyptic thinking and prophecy about a future savior.
