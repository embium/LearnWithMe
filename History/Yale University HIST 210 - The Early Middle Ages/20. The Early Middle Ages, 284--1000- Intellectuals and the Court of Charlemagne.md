### I. The Carolingian Renaissance: A Planned Revival of Learning
#### A. Background and Purpose

The Carolingian Renaissance was a deliberate effort by Charlemagne and his successors to revive classical learning, aiming to restore the Roman Empire's state form of rulership for the benefit of a diverse population. Unlike the spontaneous revival in several Italian cities during the Italian Renaissance, the Carolingian Renaissance was driven by the state's mission to revive Latin, classical literature, and texts to deepen the piety of the population and preserve learning from both Roman secular and religious texts.

#### B. Key Features

- **Classical Manuscripts**: The Carolingian Renaissance saw a significant increase in classical manuscripts, with 290 surviving from the ninth century alone, many of which were copied from Italian originals.
- **Centers of Learning**: The centers of learning included Aachen, Corbie, Tours, St. Gall, and Reichenau, which saw a growth in their libraries during this period.
- **Standardization of Education**: Charlemagne surrounded himself with intellectuals, monks, and scholars to standardize education in the Church and government, promoting uniformity and discipline throughout his realm.

#### C. Intellectuals and Scholars

Charlemagne's court was renowned for its intellectual pursuits, attracting scholars from across Europe. Einhard, a biographer of Charlemagne and a monastic entrepreneur involved in acquiring relics from Italy, exemplifies this era's blend of piety and learning. His involvement in the acquisition and relocation of relics highlights the importance of these sacred objects in medieval society.

#### D. Preservation of Classical Civilization

The Carolingian Renaissance played a crucial role in preserving classical civilization, with many of its achievements still influencing education today. The standardization of Latin and the preservation of texts by authors such as Polybius, Livy, and Tacitus are notable examples of this legacy.

### II. Relics and Their Significance
#### A. Importance of Relics

Relics were highly valued in medieval society for their believed ability to perform miracles, such as medical cures. The story of the relics of Saint Marcellinus highlights the importance of these sacred objects, where they were believed to be active and capable of performing miracles.

#### B. Miracles and Their Significance

The account of the emissaries tasked with moving the relics encountering difficulties opening the altar containing Saint Marcellinus' body, but being able to lift the tombstone covering the sepulcher of Saints Marcellinus and Peter after praying and adoring them, demonstrates the shared piety between the learned elite and ordinary villagers during the Carolingian Renaissance. This shared belief in the power of relics underscores the importance of these objects in medieval society.

#### C. Examples of Miracles

- **Medical Cures**: The account includes a story about an angry peasant with a humpback who was cured after being shown the relics, demonstrating the believed efficacy of saints.
- **Punishment for Scoffers**: Unlike Gregory of Tours' accounts, which often feature scoffers punished or people doubting the efficacy of saints, this miracle highlights the importance of faith and belief in medieval society.
