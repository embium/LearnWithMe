### I. The Transformation of the Roman Empire (4th Century)

#### A. The Rise of Christianity

The fourth century was a pivotal period in Roman history, marked by the conversion of Constantine and the subsequent rise of Christianity as a dominant force. This transformation had far-reaching consequences for the Roman Empire, its people, and the Church itself.

- **Christianity's official recognition**: In 393, Emperor Theodosius declared Christianity the sole legal religion, except for Judaism. However, this did not mean that everyone in the Empire was a practicing Christian; many people continued to practice traditional polytheistic worship or assimilated it to Christianity.
- **Internal conflicts and heresies**: During this period, the Church faced internal conflicts and heresies, such as Arianism and Donatism. Arianism posited that Christ was created by God, while Donatism questioned the legitimacy of priests who had compromised their faith under persecution.

#### B. The Emergence of New Ideas and Conflicts

The fourth century saw significant changes in the Roman Empire, marked by:

- **Social mobility**: As the Empire continued to decline, social mobility increased, allowing barbarians to become important figures in the Roman army.
- **Barbarian influence**: The rise of influential figures like Julian the Apostate, who attempted to restore traditional Roman religion but ultimately failed, highlighted the weakness of paganism and the growing dominance of Christianity.

#### C. The Catholic Church's Ecumenical Councils

The Catholic Church convened ecumenical councils during this period to address internal conflicts and establish a universal creed. Notable examples include:

- **The Council of Nicaea (325)**: Convened by Emperor Constantine, the council defined the relationship between God and Christ as being of the same essence but different persons.
- **Ongoing debates**: The definition led to ongoing debates about the nature of Christ and God for nearly 50 years, with Constantine's views on the matter changing over time.

#### D. Key Figures and Their Impact

Influential figures like Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria, opposed Arian perspectives and would later be considered a saint for upholding orthodoxy. The baptism of Emperor Constantine by an Arian priest before his death raised concerns about the validity of his baptism, highlighting complexities surrounding sin, good, and evil in human beings.
