### I. The Survival of the Eastern Roman Empire
#### A. Overview of the Paradox

The survival of the Eastern Roman Empire, based in Constantinople, presents a paradox compared to its Western counterpart, which collapsed in the fifth century. Despite facing numerous threats, including invasions, sieges, and internal division due to religious controversy, also known as heresies, the Eastern Roman Empire endured for 400 years.

#### B. Geography and Trade Networks

Geography played a significant role in the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire. Constantinople's strategic location made it easier to defend against external threats. The city's commercial importance and extensive trade networks also contributed to its resilience. The empire's control over key trade routes allowed it to maintain economic stability, which in turn supported its military and administrative structures.

#### C. Civilian Administration and Military Strength

The East Roman government maintained a strong civilian structure of administration, which helped the empire to function effectively despite internal conflicts and external threats. The army did not fall apart like the Western Empire's, indicating that the Eastern Roman Empire had a more effective system for maintaining military strength and discipline.

#### D. External Threats and Internal Religious Dissent

The Eastern Roman Empire faced challenges from external threats, including invasions by Persia and the Avars in the Balkans. The controversy surrounding Christ's nature, with the Nestorians emphasizing his human side and the Monophysites stressing his divine aspect, led to a split within Christianity. This internal religious dissent weakened the empire and created divisions among its people.

#### E. Arab Muslim Invasion and Decline

The Arab Muslim invasion of the seventh century would eventually take over the Monophysite territories, but not before the Eastern Roman Empire had experienced significant decline. Despite this, the empire managed to resist invasions and maintain its dominance over Constantinople.

### II. Challenges in the Late Sixth and Seventh Centuries
#### A. Incursions by the Avars and Persia

The Byzantine Empire faced numerous challenges in the late sixth and seventh centuries, including the Avars' incursions into the Balkans and Persia's attacks on Egypt and Syria. These external threats put pressure on the empire's military resources and weakened its control over key territories.

#### B. Heraclius' Resistance Against Persia

Heraclius led a resistance against the Persians, using tactics such as deploying icons on the city walls to boost morale. This effort demonstrated the empire's ability to adapt and respond to external threats, but ultimately, it was unable to prevent the loss of key territories.

#### C. The Fall of Egypt and the True Cross

The empire would eventually collapse under Arab rule, with the True Cross being taken in 638 and Egypt falling in 645. This marked a significant turning point in the history of the Byzantine Empire, as it lost control over key territories and faced increased pressure from external threats.

### III. Legacy and Impact
#### A. The Survival of the Monophysites

The Eastern Roman Empire's survival was marked by its ability to resist invasions and maintain control over Constantinople. Despite internal conflicts and external threats, the empire managed to endure for centuries, albeit in a weakened state. The legacy of this period can be seen in the modern-day Copts and Ethiopian Christians, who are descendants of the Monophysites.

#### B. Iconoclasm and Its Impact

The Byzantine Empire's military and religious landscape was marked by sieges, barbarian invasions, and heresies, including iconoclasm, which emerged in the late seventh century as a crisis of the empire. Iconoclasts believed that images, like icons, were dangerous and led to idolatry, while Islam, with its monotheist manifestations, banned representation of divine figures. The controversy surrounding iconoclasm lasted for over 150 years, dividing the Empire at times and being supported by emperors as a means to unify the people around their figure.

#### C. The Era of Prosperity

As the ninth century approached, cities outside Constantinople had declined into fortresses, trade was minimal, and society became increasingly militarized and religious. Despite this, the Byzantine Empire would soon enter an era of surprising prosperity, which will be discussed later in the course.
