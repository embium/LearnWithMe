### I. The Rise of the Carolingian Dynasty
#### A. Background and Context

The Carolingian dynasty rose to power in Northern Europe during the early eighth century, following the decline of the Roman Empire. This period saw significant changes in European politics, with various factions vying for control. The Carolingians' strategy was to create legitimacy through military leadership, alliances with the Church, and monastic reforms.

#### B. Key Figures and Events

- **Charles Martel**: His victory at the Battle of Poitiers in 733 marked a high point for Arab incursions into Europe.
- **Pepin the Short**: He began to consolidate power by favoring the Church and mobilizing new legitimacy through this alliance. In 751, Pepin had himself elected king of the Franks, deposed the last Merovingian ruler, and was crowned by Pope Stephen.

#### C. Charlemagne's Coronation

Charlemagne inherited his father's title and accomplishments, becoming king of the Franks at a time when the Byzantine Empire was weak and flirting with heresies like Iconoclasm. This led to a geopolitical shift, with the papacy looking to a northern transalpine ruler for protection instead of the eastern Mediterranean.

### II. Charlemagne's Leadership
#### A. Military Prowess

Charlemagne was incredibly successful as a war leader, conquering numerous peoples, including:

- **The Lombards in Italy**: He seized control of the region and incorporated it into his empire.
- **The Avars in modern-day Hungary**: His campaigns involved large numbers of civilian casualties and forced conversions to Christianity.
- **The Saxons in northern Germany**: Charlemagne's military prowess opened up the definition of modern Germany.

#### B. Christian Rule

Charlemagne was committed to educating his population and converting them to Christianity through force when necessary. He allied himself with the pope and believed that the Church could aid him in more than symbolic ways.

### III. Legacy of Rome
#### A. Revival of the Roman Empire

In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Roman emperor, an act that had implications for the balance of power between the Church and secular leaders. Charlemagne's empire was not simply a revival of the Roman Empire but also the foundation of Europe as a cultural expression.

#### B. Impact on Modern-Day Europe

Charlemagne's legacy can be seen in the modern-day European Union, with its roots in the territories of the Carolingian patrimony, including Maastricht and Brussels.
