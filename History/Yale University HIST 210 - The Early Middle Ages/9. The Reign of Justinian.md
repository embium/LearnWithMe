### I. The Importance of Primary Sources in Historical Studies
#### A. Overview of Primary Sources

The study of historical periods relies heavily on primary sources, such as writings from people who lived during those times. These sources offer vividness and immediacy, providing a firsthand account of events and experiences. However, they also present challenges due to distance and strangeness.

#### B. Challenges in Using Primary Sources
- **Distance**: Primary sources often require effort to reconstruct historical events and moods.
- **Strangeness**: The language, customs, and perspectives of people from different times can be unfamiliar and difficult to understand.
- **Bias and Perspective**: Writers like Procopius may have biases and perspectives that influence their accounts.

#### C. Examples of Primary Sources
- **Procopius' Works**: Procopius is known for his classical tradition and attention to style, but also reflects the author's biases and perspectives.
- **Gregory of Tours' Writings**: Gregory prioritizes content over form, providing valuable insights into historical events.

Justinian's reign (527-565 AD) was marked by significant conquests in North Africa, parts of Spain, and Italy, but ultimately weakened Byzantium. His rule serves as a case study for the challenges of imperial expansion and the consequences of over-extension.

#### B. Conquests and Legacy
