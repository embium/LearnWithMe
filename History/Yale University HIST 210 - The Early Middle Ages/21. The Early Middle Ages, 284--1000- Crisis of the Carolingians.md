### I. The Decline of the Carolingian Empire
#### A. Overview of Internal Challenges

The Carolingian Empire's decline was a gradual process, marked by internal problems that exacerbated external threats. Despite its size and accomplishments under Charlemagne, the empire struggled with infrastructure development, economic growth, and social cohesion. These challenges weakened the empire's foundation, making it more vulnerable to external pressures.

#### B. Economic Growth and Infrastructure Development

The Carolingian Empire faced significant difficulties in developing its economy and infrastructure. The lack of a unified system for taxation, trade, and commerce hindered economic growth. Additionally, the empire's extensive territories made it challenging to maintain a well-developed network of roads, bridges, and other essential infrastructure.

*   **Key Challenges:**
    *   Lack of a unified tax system
    *   Limited trade and commerce opportunities
    *   Inadequate infrastructure development

#### C. Social Cohesion and Internal Conflicts

The Carolingian Empire also struggled with social cohesion and internal conflicts. The empire's vast territories and diverse populations created tensions among different groups, leading to power struggles and conflicts.

*   **Key Challenges:**
    *   Social tensions between different groups
    *   Power struggles among nobles and regional leaders
    *   Conflicts over resources and territory

#### D. External Threats and the Viking Invasions

The Carolingian Empire faced significant external threats, including the Viking invasions that began before Charlemagne's death in 814. These invasions further weakened the empire, making it more vulnerable to internal conflicts and external pressures.

*   **Key Challenges:**
    *   Viking invasions and raids
    *   External pressures from neighboring kingdoms and tribes

### II. The Treaty of Verdun and Its Consequences
#### A. Background on the Treaty of Verdun

The Treaty of Verdun, signed in 843, divided the Carolingian Empire among Louis the Pious' three surviving sons: Charles the Bald, Louis the German, and Lothar. This partition set in motion a complex and often contentious history of Europe.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Division of the empire among Louis' sons
    *   Creation of new kingdoms and territories

#### B. The Middle Realm and Its Strategic Flaws

The middle realm, allocated to Lothar, was strategically flawed and prone to division. This led to a period of fragmentation, where counties that had originally been administrative divisions of the Empire became nearly independent principalities feuding with each other.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Strategic flaws in the middle realm
    *   Fragmentation of territories and principalities

#### C. The Legacy of Verdun

The legacy of Verdun is tremendous, with significant consequences for centuries to come. The ambiguous division of the Carolingian realm led to border shifting and map changes, persisting to this day.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Border shifting and map changes
    *   Persistent linguistic, cultural, and political ambiguities

### III. Fragmentation and Regional Rulers
#### A. The Decline of Central Power

The central power weakened after the Treaty of Verdun, allowing local rulers like counts of Barcelona, Aquitaine, and Bavaria to gain independence.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Weakening of central power
    *   Emergence of regional rulers and independent principalities

#### B. The Rise of Regional Rulers

Regional rulers like counts of Barcelona or Flanders emerged as effective leaders, tying together castellans who controlled local castles. Despite this fragmentation, the society remained exploitative, with violence used to control peasants and extract wealth.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Emergence of regional rulers
    *   Exploitation of peasants and use of violence

#### C. The State of Europe by 1000 AD

By 1000 AD, Europe had still not overcome issues of invasions, large politics falling apart, and lack of administrative control over powerful individuals. However, something was accomplished in the preceding centuries that would be addressed in future classes.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Persistent challenges facing Europe
    *   Opportunities for growth and development in the centuries to come
