### I. The Seventh Century: A Turning Point in Post-Roman History
#### A. The Rise of Islam and Its Impact on the Byzantine Empire

The seventh century marked a significant turning point in the history of the post-Roman world and early Middle Ages. The rise of Islam led to radical changes in Mediterranean territories, particularly those conquered from the Eastern Roman Empire by Byzantium. This shift changed the shape of the Byzantine Empire, its orientation, and culture.

**Key Term:** _Byzantium_ refers to the city that would eventually become Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire.

The expansion of Islam under the Rashidun Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate led to the conquest of vast territories, including parts of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire was forced to adapt to this new reality, leading to significant changes in its military, administrative, and cultural structures.

#### B. Challenges Faced by the Byzantine Empire

Following Justinian's expansion, his empire began to unravel mere years after his death, with Italy taking twenty years to wrest from the Ostrogoths and being invaded by the Lombards just three years later. The Byzantine Empire faced numerous crises, including:

*   **Sieges of Constantinople:** In 674 and 717, the city was besieged by Arab forces, but the empire managed to withstand these attacks.
*   **Invasions by various groups:** The Avars and Slavs invaded the empire's territories, posing significant threats to its stability.
*   **Internal conflicts:** The empire struggled with internal power struggles, corruption, and economic decline.

Despite these challenges, the Byzantine Empire managed to survive through strategic positioning, successful sneak attacks, and the use of "Greek fire." The emperors also implemented policies like deporting whole peoples and settling them on new lands, which increased the population of key frontier regions in the East with militarized forces transported from the Balkans.

#### C. Strategies for Survival

The Byzantine Empire employed several strategies to endure despite facing numerous crises and enemies throughout its history:

*   **Strategic positioning:** The empire positioned itself strategically, taking advantage of geography and alliances to maintain its power.
*   **Successful sneak attacks:** The Byzantines used surprise attacks to gain an upper hand in battles against their enemies.
*   **Use of "Greek fire":** This incendiary weapon was used to devastating effect on the battlefield, giving the Byzantines a significant advantage over their opponents.

### II. Rebirth and Expansion (843-1000)
#### A. The Organization of the Army

The Byzantine Empire underwent significant changes after 843, marked by a rebirth and expansion that lasted until 1000. The Empire's military structure was reorganized into a system of "themes," which combined civilian and military rule, with provinces responsible for their own soldiers and revenues.

**Key Term:** _Themes_ refer to the administrative and military divisions of the Byzantine Empire, which were responsible for their own defense and taxation.

This led to a militarization of society, where the male population played a significant role in the military forces. The organization of the army by locality instead of as a mobile force helped address problems related to paying the army.

#### B. Territorial Gains

The Empire grew by about one third during this period, regaining control over territories lost to Islam, including modern-day Greece, Cyprus, Crete, and parts of Italy. The Bulgars were defeated definitively by 1019, and the Abbasids were also defeated.

### III. Cultural, Artistic, and Religious Achievements
#### A. Conversion of the Slavs

This era saw great cultural, artistic, and religious achievements, including the conversion of the Slavs and much of Eastern Europe to Orthodox Christianity. The official split between the Orthodox and Catholic worlds occurred in 1054, with significant differences already visible in the ninth and tenth centuries.

**Key Term:** _Orthodox Christianity_ refers to the Christian faith practiced by the Byzantine Empire and its successor states, which emphasized the authority of tradition and the importance of icons.

### IV. Legacy of the Byzantine Empire
#### A. Influence on the Russian Empire

The Byzantine Empire's legacy can be seen in the Russian Empire, which inherited many aspects of Byzantine civilization, including its style of worship, icons, and imperial traditions.
