### I. The Crisis of the Roman Empire (235-285 AD)

#### A. Causes of Instability

The Roman Empire faced a severe crisis in the third century due to a combination of internal weaknesses and external pressures. The empire's size, urban-rural imbalance, and East-West demographic disparities created long-term vulnerabilities that contributed to its downfall. Invasions by Persia and barbarian tribes across the Danube-Rhine frontier further strained the empire's resources.

- **Urbanization**: The rapid growth of cities in the Roman Empire led to an imbalance between urban and rural populations. This created social, economic, and administrative challenges for the government.
- **Demographic Disparities**: The East and West regions of the empire had different demographic characteristics, which affected the distribution of resources and the ability to respond to external threats.

#### B. Succession Problems and Militarization

The succession of emperors became increasingly unstable, with at least 30 rulers between 235 and 285 AD. Many of these emperors were assassinated or killed in battle, leading to a militarization of society. Generals raised by their troops held power, often using their armies to take control.

- **Instability**: The frequent changes in leadership created an environment of uncertainty and instability, making it difficult for the empire to respond effectively to external threats.
- **Militarization**: The reliance on military leaders led to a militarization of society, where the army became a dominant force in politics and governance.

#### C. Economic Instability

The Roman economy suffered from inflation caused by debasement of the coinage, which led to hyperinflation and economic chaos. The local elite was undermined by taxation, militarization, and the rise of cosmopolitanism, leading to a decline in local religion and polytheism.

- **Inflation**: The repeated devaluation of currency led to inflation, which eroded the purchasing power of citizens and created economic hardship.
- **Taxation**: The burden of taxation fell heavily on the local elite, who were forced to pay for the empire's military campaigns and administrative costs.
- **Cosmopolitanism**: The rise of cosmopolitanism led to a decline in local religion and polytheism, as people became more focused on their own interests and less concerned with traditional values.

### II. Diocletian's Reforms (284-305 AD)

#### A. Introduction

Diocletian emerged as a general who would reform the empire through radical measures, including the establishment of a more efficient tax system, a state supply system for the army, and a postal system for rapid communication. He also introduced the Tetrarchy, a rule of four emperors that divided the empire into East and West.

- **Taxation**: Diocletian established a new tax system that was more efficient and equitable, allowing the state to collect more resources and pay for its administrative and military costs.
- **State Supply System**: The introduction of a state supply system ensured that the army had access to food, clothing, and other essential supplies, reducing their reliance on local markets.

#### B. The Tetrarchy

Diocletian introduced the Tetrarchy, a system where two emperors (Augusti) were assisted by two subordinates (Caesars), to share power and alleviate the burden on individual rulers. However, this system ultimately failed due to lack of cooperation between the Augusti and Caesars.

- **Tetrarchy**: The Tetrarchy was an attempt to divide power among four emperors, with each region having its own ruler and subordinates.
- **Failure**: Despite its initial success, the Tetrarchy ultimately failed due to the inability of the Augusti and Caesars to work together effectively.

#### C. Other Reforms

Diocletian's other major initiative was an edict on prices aimed at combating inflation, but it proved unsuccessful and created black markets instead. The Roman Empire's economy was eventually stabilized through reforms in taxation, allowing the state to collect more resources and pay for its administrative and military costs.

- **Edict on Prices**: Diocletian's attempt to control prices led to a shortage of goods and the emergence of black markets.
- **Taxation Reforms**: The eventual stabilization of the economy was achieved through reforms in taxation, which allowed the state to collect more resources and pay for its administrative and military costs.

### III. Legacy of Diocletian's Reforms

#### A. Impact on the Empire

Despite some failures, including the persecution of Christians, Diocletian's policies had a lasting impact on the empire, saving it for 100 years and shaping the Byzantine Empire that lasted until 1453.

- **Legacy**: Diocletian's reforms had a significant impact on the Roman Empire, allowing it to survive for another century.
- **Byzantine Empire**: The legacy of Diocletian's reforms can be seen in the establishment of the Byzantine Empire, which lasted until 1453.

#### B. Changes in the Fourth Century

The fourth century was marked by increasing prosperity and stability, with people celebrating the restoration of peace and prosperity after centuries of turmoil. However, changes were underway, including shifts in the center of gravity to military bases and cities like Trier and Milan, which would eventually lead to a new world under Constantine's rule.

- **Prosperity**: The fourth century saw an increase in prosperity and stability, as people celebrated the end of centuries of turmoil.
- **Changes**: Despite this stability, changes were underway that would ultimately lead to a new era under Constantine's rule.
