### I. Gregory of Tours' Historical Context
#### A. Life and Experiences as a Roman Senatorial Family Member and Bishop of Tours

Gregory of Tours was a prominent figure in the early Middle Ages, serving as a Roman senatorial family member and bishop of Tours. His experiences and perspectives shaped his historical narrative, which blended elements of history and hagiography. As a historian and political actor, Gregory was deeply involved with the Merovingian rulers, navigating complex relationships and making difficult decisions.

- **Key Term:** Hagiography refers to the biographical writing of saints or other notable figures in Christian tradition.
- **Context:** Gregory's life as a bishop and his interactions with the Merovingian rulers influenced his historical narrative, which often prioritized spiritual and supernatural themes over purely secular events.

#### B. Historical Narrative Style

Gregory's work, "The Book of Histories," is characterized by its disorganization and seemingly random transitions between different stories and themes. This style is reminiscent of modern media, where information is presented in a fragmented and non-linear fashion. Unlike Procopius' "Secret History," which presents a clear and linear account of events, Gregory's narrative is more complex and nuanced.

- **Key Term:** Hagiography can also refer to the blending of historical and hagiographical elements, as seen in Gregory's work.
- **Example:** The inclusion of miraculous events and supernatural themes in Gregory's narrative reflects his Augustinian view that the world has fallen and good people are scarce in power.

#### C. Attitude Towards the Franks

Gregory's attitude towards the Franks is complex, viewing them as thugs and barbarians, yet also as the people of Israel reborn as a favored race by God. The Franks claimed descent from refugees of fallen Troy, similar to the Romans, and their leaders were known for their long hair, which symbolized dynastic charisma.

- **Key Term:** Augustinian view refers to the idea that the world has fallen and good people are scarce in power.
- **Context:** Gregory's portrayal of the Franks reflects his own historical context and his interactions with the Merovingian rulers. His narrative emphasizes the supernatural interpenetration of the physical or historical world, where people are instruments of the Lord and can be forceful in advancing God's work.

### II. Historical Model and Themes
#### A. Biblical Influence

Gregory's historical model is the Bible, where violence and miracles are intertwined. He sees himself as a continuator of biblical history, portraying Clovis, the Frankish king, as a thug who murders his family members to prevent them from laying claim to power, yet also as a Christian leader who converts and forces conversion on others.

- **Key Term:** Continuator refers to someone who continues or follows in the footsteps of another.
- **Example:** Gregory's narrative is characterized by its emphasis on the supernatural interpenetration of the physical or historical world, where people are instruments of the Lord and can be forceful in advancing God's work.

#### B. Emphasis on Supernatural Forces

Gregory's narrative emphasizes the role of supernatural forces in shaping human history. He portrays Clovis as a leader who harnesses these forces to consolidate power and maintain stability in medieval France. The Catholic point of view holds that a bishop's intervention was necessary to restore sight to an individual who had been bribed by an evil bishop to feign blindness.

- **Key Term:** Supernatural interpenetration refers to the idea that spiritual or divine forces intersect with the physical world.
- **Context:** Gregory's emphasis on supernatural forces reflects his Augustinian view that the world has fallen and good people are scarce in power. His narrative prioritizes the role of leaders who can harness these forces to advance God's work.

### III. Merovingian Dynasty
#### A. Consolidation of Power

Clovis consolidated a large kingdom in medieval France, receiving favor from the Church due to his Catholicism and leveraging its resources for his rule. His conversion around 500 AD gave him an advantage over the Visigoths, who wouldn't become Catholic until later.

- **Key Term:** Catholicism refers to the Christian faith as practiced by the Roman Catholic Church.
- **Context:** Gregory's narrative portrays the Merovingian dynasty as having a sophisticated administration, collecting taxes, and maintaining public land revenue. Despite their limitations in power, which are partly military and partly supernatural, the Merovingians maintained stability through a complex interplay of natural and supernatural forces.

#### B. Division and Power Struggles

The division of Clovis' kingdom among his sons led to violence and power struggles, with Chlothar's queen Clotilde being tricked into allowing her nephews to be killed by their uncles. Despite this, Gregory portrays the Merovingian dynasty as having a complex administration and maintaining stability through a combination of natural and supernatural forces.

- **Key Term:** Natural forces refer to the physical or material aspects of human society.
- **Context:** Gregory's narrative emphasizes the role of leaders who can harness supernatural forces to advance God's work. The Merovingian dynasty, despite its limitations, maintained power for approximately 250 years through a complex interplay of natural and supernatural forces.
