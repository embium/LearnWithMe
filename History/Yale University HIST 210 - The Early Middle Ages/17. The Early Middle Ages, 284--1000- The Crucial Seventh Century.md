### I. The Seventh Century Turning Point
#### A. Overview of a Transformative Era

The seventh century marked a significant turning point in world history, as the rise of Islam led to the breakup of the Mediterranean into distinct cultural and political realms. This transformation had far-reaching consequences, shaping the course of European, Islamic, and Byzantine histories.

#### B. The Rise of Northern Europe
- **Northern Europe's Emergence**: Prior to the seventh century, Northern Europe was peripheral to the Roman Empire. However, with the rise of Islam, this region began to take on greater importance.
- **Irish Missionaries' Role**: Irish missionaries played a crucial role in preserving knowledge and diffusing Christianity throughout Europe.
- **Britain as a Center of Latin Learning**: Britain became a hub for Latin learning, showcasing the region's growing intellectual and cultural significance.

#### C. The Byzantine Empire's Crisis
- **Loss of Egypt and Decline of Cities**: The Byzantine Empire experienced a crisis, marked by the loss of Egypt and the decline of its cities.
- **"Radical Simplification of Material Culture"**: This period was characterized by a significant reduction in material culture, reflecting the empire's struggles to maintain power and influence.

#### D. The Beginning of Europe's Distinction from Asia and Africa
- **The Mediterranean Becomes a Separate Region**: The seventh century saw the start of Europe's distinction from Asia and Africa, with the Mediterranean becoming a separate region.
- **Transformation Rather Than Collapse**: This shift was not a complete collapse but rather a transformation that laid the groundwork for future developments.

#### E. The Islamic World's Continued Influence
- **Cultural Efflorescence and Scientific Curiosity**: The Islamic world continued to be a major force, marked by its own cultural efflorescence and scientific curiosity.
- **Diminishing Communication with Christianity**: As Islam expanded its control over the former Eastern Roman Empire, communication and cultural exchange between the Islamic world and Christianity diminished.

#### F. The Reorientation of Persia
- **Iran's Position Straddling Mesopotamia and India**: The reorientation of Persia played a significant role in this shift, with Iran's modern-day equivalent straddling Mesopotamia and the East towards India.
- **Hardening of Boundaries Between Western Europe and the East**: This led to a hardening of boundaries between Western Europe and the East, with Western Europe becoming less connected to Byzantium and the influences coming from the East.

#### G. The Changing Center of Gravity of the Caliphate
- **From Damascus to Baghdad**: The changing center of gravity of the Caliphate, from Damascus to Baghdad, further reflected this shift, marking a de-Mediterraneanizing of Islam.
- **Consequences for Western Europe and Byzantium**: This transformation had significant consequences for Western Europe and Byzantium, leading to a drifting apart of cultural and political realms.

#### H. The Rise of New Centers in Northern Europe
- **The End of a Secular Elite**: In the West, the seventh century saw the end of a secular elite, replaced by a smaller and more clerical elite.
- **Monasteries and Churches as Repositories of Classical Knowledge**: Monasteries and churches became the repositories of classical knowledge, marking a significant shift in the preservation and dissemination of knowledge.

#### I. Periodization and Theories
- **The "Pirenne Thesis"**: This periodization is often attributed to the "Pirenne thesis," which posits that Islam was responsible for disrupting Mediterranean trade and unity.
- **Disproven by Archaeology**: However, this theory has been largely disproven by archaeology, which shows that trade and contacts continued across the Mediterranean despite Islamic expansion.

#### J. Conclusion
- **The Start of Three Distinct Civilizations**: The seventh century marked the start of three distinct civilizations: Byzantium, the flowering of Eastern Roman Empire; Charlemagne's Frankish realm in Northern Europe; and the emerging Islamic world.
- **A Transformative Era with Lasting Consequences**: This period was a transformative era that had lasting consequences for European, Islamic, and Byzantine histories.
