### I. The Athenian Judicial System
#### A. Overview of the Athenian Court Structure

The Athenian judicial system, as described by Professor Kagan, may seem strange to modern eyes. It relied on a panel of 6,000 jurors who served for a year, with each day's assignments determined by a complex system designed to prevent bribery or partiality. The usual size of a jury was 501, although juries could range from 51 to 1,501 depending on the case.

#### B. Key Features of Athenian Trials

- **No public prosecutor**: In contrast to modern American courts, there was no public prosecutor in Athens. Instead, private citizens presented their cases in their own voice.
- **No lawyers or judge**: The Athenians did not have lawyers or a judge presiding over the trial. This meant that each side had to present its case without professional representation.
- **Jury's decision is final**: The jury's decision was final and binding, with no possibility of appeal.
- **Simple majority decides the issue**: A simple majority decided the issue, rather than a unanimous or supermajority vote.
- **Penalties proposed by both sides**: If a penalty was called for, both sides proposed penalties, and the jury chose one or the other.

#### C. Deterrents Against Frivolous Lawsuits

To deter frivolous lawsuits, plaintiffs who lost were required to pay a fine if they failed to win a stated percentage of jurors' votes. This system had its flaws, including quirky decisions and potential prejudice among jurors.

### II. The Athenian Democratic System
#### A. Overview of the Athenian Democracy

The Athenian democratic system has been harshly criticized throughout history for its perceived flaws. However, Professor Kagan argues that it had many attractions, particularly in comparison to modern American court procedures.

#### B. Key Features of the Athenian Democracy

- **Rejection of expertise and experience**: The Athenians rejected expertise and experience in favor of a more direct and participatory form of democracy.
- **Enlightened and sophisticated voters**: Professor Kagan suggests that the Athenians' voters were enlightened and sophisticated, despite their lack of formal education or training.
- **Assembly as a less unwieldy body**: The assembly itself was a less unwieldy and incompetent body than critics assumed.

#### C. Challenges to the Athenian Democracy

Despite informal deterrents and formal devices to encourage careful speech, some ignorant individuals may have still played a role in deliberations. However, the Athenian democracy persisted for 140 years, showing restraint and moderation despite its inherent instability and potential for factionalism.

### III. Property Rights and Economic Equality
#### A. Respect for Property Rights

The majority of citizens respected property rights and refused to insist on economic equality, which contributed to the system's stability and durability.

#### B. Limited Economic Inequality

Despite social inequality, the Athenians managed to maintain a moderate regime for much of this period, with a small but influential group of wealthy citizens coexisting alongside thousands of poor people.

### IV. Slavery in Ancient Athens
#### A. Overview of Slavery in Athens

Slavery was an important aspect of ancient Greek society, with most slaves being foreigners who worked on farms or in small-scale industries.

#### B. Key Features of Athenian Slavery

- **Freedom for military-age slaves**: The Athenians took a unique approach to slavery, freeing all slaves of military age and granting citizenship to those who participated in key battles.
- **Mutual respect between masters and slaves**: This was in contrast to the Southern United States during the Civil War, where similar proposals were repeatedly rejected due to fear that freed slaves would turn against their former masters.

#### C. Comparison with Other Ancient City-States

The Athenian approach to slavery was distinct from that of other ancient city-states and even modern societies, highlighting the complexities and nuances of this complex issue.

### V. Lessons for Modern Society
#### A. Importance of Equality Before the Law

The Athenian experience offers valuable lessons for us today, highlighting the importance of equality before the law, individual freedom, and civic engagement.

#### B. Complexities and Contradictions of Ancient Greek Society

Despite its flaws, Periclean Athens remains a valuable model for us today, offering insights into the importance of equality before the law, individual freedom, and civic engagement.

#### C. Comparison with Modern Western Values

The Athenians' commitment to individual freedom, secularism, and rationality made them closer to modern Western values than any culture since antiquity. However, there were significant differences between the Athenians and ourselves, particularly in their valuation of wealth and material goods compared to public service and community involvement.

### VI. Excluded Groups in Ancient Athens
#### A. Women in Athenian Society

Women played a complex role in Athenian society, with some sources depicting them as passive and subordinate, while others showed them as powerful figures in both public and private spheres.

#### B. Slaves in Athenian Society

Slavery was an important aspect of ancient Greek society, with most slaves being foreigners who worked on farms or in small-scale industries. While some wealthy individuals owned large numbers of slaves, many families had no slaves at all, and the distribution of slavery was unequal.
