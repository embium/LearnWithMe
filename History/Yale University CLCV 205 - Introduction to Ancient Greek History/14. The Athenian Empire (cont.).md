### I. The Persian Wars: A Turning Point in Greek History
#### A. Background and Significance of the War

The Persian Wars marked a significant turning point in Greek history, with far-reaching implications beyond their earlier defeat at Marathon in 490. The war was not just about Greece's freedom from Persian rule but also about its unique style of life and culture. Aeschylus' play "Persians" captures this sentiment, highlighting the importance of defending one's homeland, family, and cultural heritage.

The war was fought on multiple fronts, with significant battles taking place at Plataea in southern Boeotia and Mycale off the coast of Asia Minor. The Greeks ultimately emerged victorious, but not without divisions emerging within their ranks. The Athenians, who had played a crucial role in the war, sought to expand their influence and protect their interests, while the Spartans, who had traditionally held power, were hesitant to cede control.

#### B. The Aftermath of the Persian Wars

The aftermath of the Persian Wars saw a significant shift in the balance of power among Greek city-states. Themistocles' clever maneuvering allowed Athens to assert its independence from Sparta, declaring itself an equal and not bound by Spartan advice or orders. This move was met with resistance from Spartans who were content to withdraw into their traditional ways, but a faction emerged that sought to exert Spartan power and influence more broadly.

The commander of the Spartan forces at Plataea, Pausanias, was recalled and put on trial for his perceived tyranny and treason, discrediting the Spartans in the eyes of other Greeks. The allies, who had been fighting against the Persians, turned to Athens and asked them to take the lead in the war that was going to come. The Athenians were ready and willing to do so, but it's unclear whether they used their power and influence to bring about this decision or if it was a joint agreement between both sides.

#### C. The Formation of the Delian League

A meeting of Greeks at Delos resulted in the formation of the Delian League, a perpetual alliance aimed at maintaining Greek freedom from Persian rule. The Delian League was a hegemonial league with Athens as its designated leader, and it had its own treasury, forces, and decision-making process. The Athenians assessed contributions from member states, which initially took the form of ships and crews but later became monetary payments.

#### D. The Functioning and Transformation of the Delian League

Initially, the Delian League functioned smoothly, with Athens having only one vote in the synod despite its significant power and influence. However, as time passed and differences of opinion arose, the Athenians began to assert their power and change the situation, ultimately leading to the league's transformation into an empire.

The challenge from Persia receded, but the problems that emerged were similar to those faced by NATO today â€“ states losing interest in the alliance when they no longer feel threatened. The Delian League, established to counter Persian influence, initially enjoyed remarkable success. In 477, Athenians drove Persians out of Eion, a town on the Strymon River in Thrace. Soon after, under Cimon's leadership, they conquered Skyros, an island inhabited by non-Greek pirates, and installed an Athenian cleruchy to secure it.

#### E. Key Events and Turning Points

*   The Delian League turned its attention to Carystos, a city on Euboea that had surrendered to Persia, compelling it to join the league and pay tribute.
*   Naxos, another island state, rebelled against the league in 470, citing the lack of Persian threat, but was put down by the league's forces, reducing it from a free ally to a subject state.
*   A significant turning point came in 469 when Cimon led the league forces to defeat the Persian fleet at Eurymedon, dealing a severe blow to Persian power in the eastern Mediterranean.

#### F. Conclusion

The Persian Wars marked a significant turning point in Greek history, with far-reaching implications for the balance of power among city-states and the emergence of panhellenism as a unifying force. The Delian League, established to counter Persian influence, initially enjoyed remarkable success but ultimately transformed into an empire due to internal divisions and the assertion of Athenian power.
