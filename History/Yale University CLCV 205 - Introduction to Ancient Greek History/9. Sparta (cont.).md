### I. The Emergence and Power of Sparta
#### A. Historical Context and Conquests

The polis of Lacedaemon, also known as Sparta, emerged in the sixth century BC and became the most powerful state in Greece. This emergence was marked by the conquest of Mycenae in the first Mycenaean War, which led to the enslavement of a whole people, creating a critical part of the Spartan population essential for the state's economy. The second Mycenaean War further solidified Sparta's unique system, where Spartans at home trained constantly for military purposes, never working or engaging in trade or industry, while others did that work for them.

#### B. The Unique System and Its Consequences

Sparta's system led to a slave-holding state like no other Greek state, with Spartans living in constant fear of helot rebellions and their neighbors' assistance. This created permanent dissatisfaction among the helots, who were essential to the state's economy but had limited rights and freedoms. The Spartan constitution was fully developed after the second Mycenaean War, featuring an agoge system where young boys were trained and educated through rigorous physical and mental challenges.

#### C. Education System and Social Structure

The Spartan education system was notorious for its harsh conditions, communal life, and lack of luxuries, making it similar to English public schools of the 19th century. Boys from age seven to thirty underwent rigorous physical training, military instruction, and musical education that emphasized moral lessons and poetry. The system was overseen by older boys or young men between twenty and thirty, who served as teachers and role models.

#### D. Social Roles and Expectations

Spartan women played a unique role in society, being treated more like men than other Greek women. They engaged in physical exercise, dancing, and athletics, and even competed naked, just like the boys. However, they were excluded from political life entirely. The marriage ceremony in Sparta was also unusual, involving the ritual seizure of the bride and her subsequent dressing as a man.

### II. Spartan Values and Culture
#### A. Virtues and Ideals

The Spartans believed in the importance of discipline, self-reliance, social cohesion, obedience to superiors, physical and moral endurance, courage, and uniformity. These values were emphasized through their education system and social structure, with a focus on producing fighting men who were loyal to one another and to the state.

#### B. Courage and Loyalty

The Spartan poet Tyrtaeus wrote that courage was the most important quality for a young man to possess, and that it was better to die with honor than to live without it. He emphasized the importance of loyalty to one's city and people, and how this could lead to immortality through fame and reputation.

#### C. Dealing with Cowards

The Spartans had a unique way of dealing with cowards, who were shunned and ostracized by society. This reflects their emphasis on courage and loyalty as essential virtues for their citizens.

### III. The Spartan Constitution
#### A. Mixed System and Checks and Balances

The Spartan constitution was a mixed system that combined elements of democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, and aristocracy. It featured two kings who held priestly responsibilities, served as generals leading the army, and acted as judges in various cases. However, their power was limited by the fact that there were two kings who could veto each other's actions, and they were subject to charges brought against them by the ephors, a group of five ordinary Spartans.

#### B. Role of the Kings

The kings played a significant role in appointing representatives to other states, selecting men to consult the Delphic Oracle, and assigning heiresses to new husbands when necessary. They also sat on the gerousia, a council of elders that advised the state, and made decisions regarding adoptions and other important matters.

#### C. Limitations on Royal Power

The system of checks and balances ensured that the kings did not accumulate too much power, and their role was more advisory than absolute. This reflects the Spartans' emphasis on balance and moderation in governance.
