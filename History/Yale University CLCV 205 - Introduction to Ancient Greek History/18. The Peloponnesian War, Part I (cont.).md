### I. The Thirty-Year Peace (445 BCE)

#### A. Background and Significance

The thirty-year peace sworn in 445 CE marked a significant period in Athenian history, where the city-state sought to maintain its empire while avoiding conflict with Sparta. This peace was crucial for understanding the character of the era and Pericles' role as negotiator, who genuinely committed to preserving peace for the future.

#### B. The Peace of Callias

The Athenians had previously made a peace with Persia, known as the Peace of Callias, which further demonstrates their desire for stability. However, this peace was not without controversy, with some questioning whether it was formal or merely a truce. Despite this, the de facto peace between Athens and Persia remained intact until 412 CE, when Sparta formed an alliance with Persia against Athens.

#### C. Pericles' Diplomatic Efforts

Pericles' actions in establishing the panhellenic colony of Thurii in southern Italy were significant, as they demonstrated Athens' commitment to maintaining peace and stability beyond its Aegean sphere of influence. The colony's constitution was modeled after Athens', but with a tenth of its population being Athenian, it was not dominated by them. This suggests that Pericles was attempting to send a diplomatic signal to the rest of the world, particularly the Spartans and their Peloponnesian allies, that Athens did not have ambitions of expanding its empire onto the mainland or out west.

### II. The Crisis in 440 BCE

#### A. Samos' Rebellion

The crisis in 440 CE, when Samos rebelled against Athens, tested the peace further. Pericles put down the rebellion by force, established a democracy, and took hostages to secure the island's loyalty. However, the defeated oligarchs received help from Persia, which led to further trouble and eventually the rebellion of Byzantium.

#### B. The Corinthians' Actions

The Corinthians' actions in 440 CE played a critical role in shaping the events leading up to the Great Peloponnesian War. They had previously been hostile towards Athens but changed their stance after receiving Pericles' diplomatic message through Thurii. This suggests that the Athenians were able to send a clear signal about their intentions and avoid conflict with Corinth, at least for a time.

### III. The Testing of Peace

#### A. The Samian Rebellion's Impact

The testing of peace in 440 CE ultimately led to its preservation, and this success strengthened the chances of maintaining peace even further. The events leading up to the Great Peloponnesian War demonstrate that peace was possible, but it required careful management and diplomacy from both sides.

#### B. The Balance of Power

A balance of power had been established in which both sides recognized each other as equals, with each having a sphere of influence from which the other was to stay. However, this balance was fragile, and the slightest disturbance could lead to conflict.

### IV. The Final Crisis: Epidamnus and Corcyra

#### A. The Civil War in Epidamnus

The civil war in Epidamnus led to Corcyra's refusal to help its colony, and then Corinth's decision to send an army to aid the besieged city. This was motivated by honor and dishonor, rather than economic gain or power.

#### B. The Athenian Dilemma

The Athenians faced a difficult decision: whether to join the Corcyraeans or maintain peace with Corinth. They ultimately decided not to take action, but this was not necessarily the safer option.

### V. Conclusion

The thirty-year peace and its subsequent testing demonstrate that peace is possible, but it requires careful management and diplomacy from both sides. The Athenians' decision not to join the Corcyraeans in their conflict with Corinth ultimately led to the Great Peloponnesian War. This war was not inevitable, but rather a result of a series of events and decisions made by both sides.
