### I. The Emergence of Greek Civilization
#### A. The Minoan Civilization (c. 3000 B.C.)

The Greek experience begins with the emergence of the Bronze Age in the Aegean Sea area around 3000 B.C., marked by the establishment of permanent dwelling areas, or cities, which involve a non-productive population that relies on others for food. The first civilization to emerge was the Minoan civilization on Crete, uncovered by archaeologists at the beginning of the twentieth century.

The Minoans left no written evidence that has been deciphered, making it difficult to understand their language and history. Their culture spread beyond Crete and is characterized by a palace complex, such as Knossos, which resembles older civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The Minoan civilization was marked by trade with the Mediterranean region, particularly in aromatic oils.

#### B. Characteristics of Minoan Culture

- **Palace Complexes**: The Minoans built large palace complexes, such as Knossos, which served as centers of power and administration.
- **Trade and Commerce**: The Minoans were involved in trade with the Mediterranean region, particularly in aromatic oils.
- **Lack of Written Evidence**: Unlike other civilizations of the time, the Minoans left no written evidence that has been deciphered.

#### C. Legacy of the Minoan Civilization

The legacy of the Minoan civilization is largely lost due to the lack of written evidence. However, some memories persisted in the form of folk memory, legend, and epic tradition. The Minoan culture had a significant impact on the development of Greek civilization, particularly in terms of trade and commerce.

### II. The Mycenaean Civilization (c. 2000 B.C.)
#### A. Overview

The Mycenaeans emerged around 2000 B.C. and were Greek speakers who established a civilization marked by trade with the Mediterranean region, particularly in aromatic oils. Their culture was unified, with a single style of pottery throughout the Aegean Sea area.

#### B. Characteristics of Mycenaean Culture

- **Monarchic System**: The Mycenaeans had a monarchic system, where the ruler held centralized control over agriculture, economy, and religion.
- **Trade and Commerce**: The Mycenaeans were involved in trade with the Mediterranean region, particularly in aromatic oils.
- **Unified Culture**: The Mycenaean culture was unified, with a single style of pottery throughout the Aegean Sea area.

#### C. Legacy of the Mycenaean Civilization

The legacy of the Mycenaean civilization is significant, and their culture had a profound impact on the development of Greek civilization. The Mycenaeans' reliance on monarchic power and centralized control over agriculture and economy was already present in Asia and Egypt, where rulers held full religious authority for their rule.

### III. The Fall of the Mycenaean World
#### A. Overview

The Mycenaean world flourished for approximately 400 years before experiencing a series of devastating events around 1200 B.C., including attacks from the sea people and other civilizations. Theories about the fall of this civilization include internal uprisings, droughts, climatic shifts, and external invasions by tribes from outside the Mediterranean region.

#### B. Causes of the Fall

- **Internal Upheaval**: One theory suggests that internal uprisings led to the downfall of the Mycenaean world.
- **External Invasions**: Another theory proposes that external invasions by tribes from outside the Mediterranean region contributed to the fall of the Mycenaean civilization.

#### C. Legacy of the Fall

The fall of the Mycenaean world had a profound impact on Greece, leading to a period known as the Dark Ages, characterized by a lack of writing and cultural isolation. The Greeks were cut off from the rest of the world, with localism and fragmentation replacing unity and exchange.

### IV. The Legacy of the Mycenaean Civilization
#### A. Overview

The legacy of the Mycenaean civilization is largely lost due to the fall of their world. However, some memories persisted in the form of folk memory, legend, and epic tradition. The Greek world was reduced to small, poor, and weak units, with survivors forced to adapt to a new way of life.

#### B. Legacy in Epic Poetry

The legacy of the Mycenaean civilization is preserved in epic poetry, which reveals that it was orally composed and recollected, suggesting a lengthy process of creation. The accurate depictions of Mycenaean aspects in these poems, written down around 750 B.C., indicate an epic tradition spanning from the Mycenaean Period to Greek history's end.

#### C. Impact on Greek Civilization

The legacy of the Mycenaean civilization had a significant impact on Greek civilization, particularly in terms of cultural identity and the development of epic poetry. The Greeks had to forge their own way, uninfluenced by external powers like Mesopotamia and Egypt, starting from scratch and shaping a new world that was uniquely theirs.
