### I. The Concept of Arête in Ancient Greek Society
#### A. Definition and Significance of Arête

The concept of arête, or excellence, played a central role in ancient Greek society as depicted in Homer's works. Derived from the Greek word aner, meaning man, arête referred to masculine qualities such as courage, beauty, strength, and athletic prowess. These virtues were highly valued in Greek culture, with heroes like Achilles and Odysseus embodying them. Achilles represented physical courage and strength, while Odysseus exemplified cleverness and skill in speech.

In Homer's world, the recognition of arête by the community was crucial for an individual to achieve glory and fame. This societal emphasis on excellence was based on shame rather than guilt, where one's worth was determined by how they were treated and greeted by others. The Greek view of human nature emphasized living in society, with individuals being conceived as part of a community.

### II. The Greek View of Human Nature and Society
#### A. Emphasis on Community Values

The Greek view of human nature emphasized the importance of living in society, with individuals being conceived as part of a community. This perspective was reflected in the concept of hybris, or violent arrogance, which described the excesses that could lead to divine retribution. In contrast, moderation was considered a key virtue for achieving a good life.

#### B. The Role of Individualism vs. Community Values

The Greek view of human nature and society highlighted the importance of community values over individualism. This approach emphasized the need for individuals to live in harmony with their community and to strive for excellence within that context.

### III. The Judeo-Christian Tradition and Human Nature
#### A. View of Human Nature as Inherently Flawed

The Judeo-Christian tradition viewed human nature as being inherently flawed and in need of salvation from God. This perspective was reflected in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, which highlighted the consequences of seeking knowledge and power.

#### B. The Role of Individualism vs. Community Values

In contrast to the Greek view, the Judeo-Christian tradition emphasized individualism over community values. This approach viewed humans as inherently flawed and in need of salvation from God, rather than as part of a larger community.

### IV. The Contrast Between Greek and Judeo-Christian Traditions
#### A. Views on Human Nature

The contrast between the Greek and Judeo-Christian traditions is evident in their views on human nature. While the Greeks saw individuals as part of a larger community, the Judeo-Christian tradition viewed humans as inherently flawed and in need of salvation from God.

This dichotomy has shaped Western civilization, with its inherent conflicts and ambiguities. In Western culture, the concept of excellence and high achievement has become ubiquitous, transcending its origins in religious organizations.

### V. The Emergence of the Polis

#### B. The Development of the Polis

The Archaic Period saw significant changes that led to the development of the full-scale polis. This period was marked by increased contact with Eastern civilizations, the rise of literacy, and the establishment of colonies in Italy and Sicily.
