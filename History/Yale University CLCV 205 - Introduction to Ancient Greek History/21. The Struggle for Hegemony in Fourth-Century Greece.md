### I. The Aftermath of the Peloponnesian War
#### A. The Rise of Spartan Power and Influence

The Peloponnesian War has finally ended after 27 years of bitter conflict. However, this newfound peace is short-lived as another kind of trouble begins to emerge. The Spartans, who had allegedly gone to war to free the Greeks, now find themselves presented with choices and opportunities that they never thought possible before. With their newfound power and wealth, courtesy of the Persians, they must decide how to conduct themselves and their state in the Greek world.

There are three possibilities: confining themselves to the Peloponnesus, extending Spartan power on the mainland outside the Peloponnesus, or contesting control of the entire Greek world with the Persians. The Spartans disagree among themselves as to what is necessary, even if they choose to take the latter path.

#### B. Lysander's Ambition and the Establishment of Decarchies

Lysander, a great victor of the war and leader of the "let's conquer it all" faction, has a personal policy that fits his own ambition for power and influence. He establishes decarchies, or governments of ten men chosen from local people friendly to him, in cities he liberates, with Spartans as garrisons to maintain order.

This new Spartan Empire is different from the Athenian Empire, which was voluntary and had a clear purpose, whereas Lysander's empire is compulsory and has no purpose. The Spartans' treatment of other Greeks is also problematic, as they feel superior and act accordingly.

#### C. The Impact on Athens and the Viability of Democracy

Athens, which had been the greatest empire in Greek history, is now reduced to total defeat and at the mercy of the Spartans. In ancient Greece, the loss of the Peloponnesian War led many to question the viability of democracy.

The Athenians' defeat was seen as a failure of their democratic system, which was perceived as inherently flawed and wicked. This view was rooted in Greek tradition, where a division between high and low, good and bad, noble and base was considered natural. The idea that all men were equal in some fundamental way was contrary to this traditional view.

### II. The Counterrevolution and the Restoration of Democracy
#### A. The Establishment of the Thirty Tyrants

After the war, Critias sought to establish a narrow oligarchy in Athens, modeled after the Spartan state, which had won the war. However, when the Thirty Tyrants took power in 404, they faced opposition from Athenians who had been exiled during the democracy.

#### B. The Counterrevolution and the Role of Thrasybulus

A small group of exiles, led by Thrasybulus and Anytus, began a counterrevolution with only 70 men, establishing a fort at Phyle to rally support against the oligarchs. The democratic snow that fell on Phyle allowed the exiles to escape and regroup, while the Thirty's forces were defeated.

Eventually, the Spartans intervened, but instead of crushing the democrats, they negotiated a settlement that led to the restoration of democracy in Athens. The newly restored democracy behaved with remarkable moderation, keeping an amnesty and not prosecuting those who had served under the oligarchs.

#### C. The Legacy of Thrasybulus

In 401, citizenship was limited to the top three Solonian classes, but this quickly fell through, and the full democracy was restored. A Roman historian from the first century B.C. wrote that if excellence were to be weighed apart from luck, he would rank Thrasybulus as the greatest of all time, surpassing even Pericles in sense of honor, steadfastness, and love of country.

A few centuries later, Pausanias described Thrasybulus' grave as the first on a list of famous Athenians, with his own being placed alongside that of Pericles, indicating a level of esteem that is extraordinary given our current understanding of him. The fact that these ancient writers sang Thrasybulus' praises while we have barely heard of him presents a great puzzle, suggesting that lost histories may have attributed to him the kind of credit for his remarkable achievements that doesn't appear in Xenophon and Diodorus or the orators.

#### D. Remembering Thrasybulus

It is our obligation to future generations to not let Thrasybulus' name lie in obscurity again, and to remember that he is the only Greek whose name fits a Yale fight song - Thrasybulus, Thrasybulus.
