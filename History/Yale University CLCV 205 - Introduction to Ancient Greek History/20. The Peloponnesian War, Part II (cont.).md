### I. Pericles' Role as General During the Peloponnesian War
#### A. Overview of Pericles' Leadership and Strategy

Pericles played a significant role in the Peloponnesian War as the elected strategos, or general, of Athens. His leadership has been subject to intense criticism and defense throughout history. While some have praised his leadership, others have condemned it as cowardly and ineffective. Pericles chose to adopt a defensive strategy of "exhaustion," aiming to convince the Spartans that war against Athens was futile by avoiding land battles and launching naval raids on the Peloponnesus.

#### B. The Unorthodox Nature of Pericles' Strategy

Pericles' approach was unprecedented in Greek history, running counter to the traditional values of bravery and steadfastness in battle. Despite its unorthodox nature, his strategy allowed the Athenians to maintain their city's safety while inflicting psychological damage on the enemy. However, the strategy ultimately failed due to the unexpected outbreak of a terrible plague that killed a third of the Athenian population and encouraged the Peloponnesians to continue fighting.

#### C. The Impact of Pericles' Strategy

Pericles' failure to adopt a more offensive approach earlier in the war remains one of the most weighty charges against him. His strategy was based on his understanding of human psychology and the importance of morale in warfare. He believed that by avoiding direct confrontation and instead focusing on economic and naval power, he could create an environment where the Spartans would be more likely to negotiate a peace treaty rather than continuing to fight.

#### D. Criticisms of Pericles' Leadership

Pericles' approach ultimately failed, as the Spartans continued to fight and eventually launched a devastating invasion of Attica in 431. The Athenians suffered significant losses, including the ravaging of their lands and homes, and were also plagued by the plague that killed great numbers of them and destroyed their moral fiber. Despite his failures, Pericles remained committed to his strategy, believing that it was still possible to achieve victory through a combination of naval power and economic warfare.

#### E. Legacy of Pericles' Leadership

Pericles' legacy is complex, with some historians viewing him as a great leader who made difficult decisions to protect Athens, while others see him as a cautious and ineffective general who failed to adapt to changing circumstances. Regardless, his strategy during the Peloponnesian War remains an important case study in the history of warfare, highlighting the challenges of balancing military effectiveness with political and economic considerations.

### II. Alternative Strategies and Outcomes
#### A. The General's Argument Against Pericles' Leadership

The general who succeeded Pericles made a strong argument against his leadership, suggesting that he may not have been effective in avoiding battles and thus may not be a strong commander. In contrast, Pericles' mistakes can be attributed more to his strategic decisions rather than his overall command abilities.

#### B. Alternative Strategies and Outcomes

If the Athenians had pursued a limited aggressive program after Pericles' death, taking key territories and launching attacks from them without engaging in major battles, they might have been able to achieve their desired outcome of maintaining the empire intact. In fact, this approach was attempted by others, including Cleon and Demosthenes, who successfully took Pylos and Cythera, leading the Spartans to offer peace.

#### C. The Importance of Adaptability in Warfare

The Athenians' refusal to accept the Spartan offer of peace in 425 led to continued conflict, but they did achieve a peace agreement in 421 that ultimately broke down. However, had they succeeded in defeating the Spartan army in the Peloponnesus, they would have effectively ended Sparta's dominance over the Greeks, demonstrating that they had opportunities to win the war through different strategies.

### III. Conclusion
Pericles' role as general during the Peloponnesian War remains a complex and debated topic among historians. While his strategy of "exhaustion" was unprecedented in Greek history, it ultimately failed due to the unexpected outbreak of a terrible plague and the Spartans' continued fighting spirit. The Athenians' refusal to adapt their strategy and pursue more aggressive tactics led to significant losses and ultimately contributed to the war's outcome.
