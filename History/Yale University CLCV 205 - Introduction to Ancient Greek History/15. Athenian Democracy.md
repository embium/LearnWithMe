### I. The Athenian Empire's Development: A Shift from Free Association to Imperial Power

#### A. The Thasian Rebellion (465 BCE): A Turning Point in Athenian History

The Thasian Rebellion marked a significant turning point in the development of the Athenian Empire, as it shifted the focus from a free association of states to an imperial power where Athens used its influence to achieve strictly Athenian advantages. The conflict over gold and silver mines on Mount Pangaean opposite Thasos Island was not about fulfilling league duties but rather a dispute between Athens and Thasos over resources. The Athenians' victory after a two-year siege led to the imposition of tribute and indemnity on Thasos, marking a shift in the league's character.

#### B. Ancient Writers' Perspectives: Diodorus and Thucydides

The ancient writers, Diodorus and Thucydides, provide different perspectives on this transition. Diodorus depicts the Athenians as tyrannical and responsible for defections among their allies, while Thucydides attributes the failures of the league to the allies' own actions, such as refusing military service or paying tribute. Both sources agree that the Athenians had become high-handed in their dealings with their allies.

#### C. The Impact on the Delian League

The transformation of the Delian League into an empire was further solidified by the rise of Cimon to prominence in Athens. As a nobleman and great commander, he became incredibly popular among the masses due to his successes in commanding the Athenian forces and bringing wealth and booty back to the city. His conservative foreign policy, which favored alliance with Sparta, also contributed to his popularity.

### II. The Rise of Cimon: A Conservative Foreign Policy

#### A. Cimon's Popularity and Influence

Cimon's control of Athenian affairs was not without controversy. He became incredibly popular among the masses due to his successes in commanding the Athenian forces and bringing wealth and booty back to the city. His conservative foreign policy, which favored alliance with Sparta, also contributed to his popularity.

#### B. The Areopagites' Constitution

However, Cimon's control of Athenian affairs was not without controversy. The Areopagites' Constitution, which emerged during his period of dominance, saw the old aristocratic council gaining unofficial power and influence over foreign policy. This development rolled back some degree of democracy in Athens, as the poor were excluded from many activities of the state.

#### C. Opposition to Cimon: Ephialtes and Pericles

The Thasian Rebellion proved to be a turning point for Cimon, as he faced opposition from Ephialtes and Pericles, who sought to undermine his conservative approach and promote greater democratization and anti-Spartan policies. Despite being accused of bribery by the King of Macedonia, Cimon's reputation remained intact, and his influence continued to shape Athenian politics until his eventual downfall.

### III. The Athenian Democracy: A Unique Blend of Direct Sovereignty and Limited Executive Authority

#### A. The Trial Against Cimon and Its Aftermath

The trial against Cimon, a prominent politician, had been launched by Pericles, but it ended in defeat for the latter. This marked a turning point in the political landscape of Athens, as Ephialtes' attempts to discredit the Areopagus through taxations and charges against individual members failed.

#### B. The Spartans and Internal Strife

The Spartans were facing internal strife due to a helot rebellion triggered by a devastating earthquake in 464 BCE. Cimon proposed sending an army of four thousand hoplites to aid the Spartans, but Ephialtes opposed this, arguing that Athens should not support its former ally.

#### C. The First Peloponnesian War

Despite losing the argument, the Athenians sent a force to Sparta, which ultimately failed to achieve their objectives and was dismissed by the Spartans. This event marked a significant breach in relations between Athens and Sparta, with the latter developing a fear of the Athenian soldiers' revolutionary spirit.

#### D. The Establishment of a More Democratic Constitution

Pericles' reforms would go on to establish a more democratic constitution, granting full participation to adult male citizens and direct power to the assembly and popular law courts. The Athenian democracy was characterized by its unique blend of direct sovereignty, limited executive authority, and judicial functions.

#### E. Checks on Power: A System of Governance

The Athenian system of governance was characterized by a unique blend of democratic principles and careful checks on power. The people had significant control over officials chosen by election, with regular votes to determine their conduct and potential punishment if found guilty. However, most public offices were filled through allotment, a process that ensured equality among citizens and prevented the concentration of executive or administrative power in the hands of a few individuals.

#### F. Accountability and Term Limits

Even generals, who required special skills, were limited to short terms, with reelection possible but not guaranteed. This system allowed ordinary citizens to manage public life, keeping it separate from the influence of experts and professionals.
