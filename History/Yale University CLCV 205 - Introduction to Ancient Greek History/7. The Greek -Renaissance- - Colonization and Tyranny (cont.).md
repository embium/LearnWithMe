### I. The Emergence of the Polis in Ancient Greece
#### A. Historical Context and Dating

The rise of the polis (city-state) in ancient Greece was marked by the emergence of a new class of people, the farmer-hoplite citizen. This phenomenon developed over a stretch of centuries with distinct characteristics. One way to date the establishment of the polis is through Greek traditions about the founding of colonies throughout the Mediterranean.

- **Greek Traditions and Archaeological Discoveries**: The earliest colony, according to Greek tradition, was founded around 773 B.C., but the most widely accepted date for the general phenomenon of colonization is roughly 750 B.C. Archaeological discoveries have confirmed this general dating, although it remains approximate.
- **Motivations for Colonization**: The desire to acquire farmland and establish a new home was likely a primary motivation for Greeks to leave their mother cities and settle in other regions. This movement was not unique to ancient Greece, as similar patterns can be observed in other cultures.

#### B. The Role of the Delphic Oracle

The establishment of colonies required careful planning, including consultation with the Delphic Oracle, which served as a valuable information-gathering device for Greeks seeking to establish new settlements.

- **Consultation and Planning**: Once a colony was founded, it would typically draft its own charter, outlining the governmental structure and land allocation. The relationship between the apoikia (colony) and metropolis (mother city) varied but friendly relations were typical.
- **Recruitment of Settlers**: Colonies would recruit settlers from the mother city or other regions through festivals like the Olympic Games.

#### C. Relationships Between Colonies and Mother Cities

The Greek world had already expanded significantly before the rise of the polis and colonization period. After the collapse of the Mycenaean world, people fled eastward into the Aegean Sea and Asia Minor, establishing cities along the coast.

- **Friendly Relations**: The typical relationship between a colony and its mother city was one of friendly relations, with the colony sending representatives back to the mother city for religious observations and trade.
- **Mutual Agreement**: Colonies were often established by mutual agreement, rather than force or imposition. Corinth had a special relationship with Potidaea, which led them to send an army to fight on behalf of their colony when it was besieged.

#### D. Conflict Between Colonies and Mother Cities

However, not all relationships between colonies and mother cities were harmonious. Corinth and Corcyra, for instance, had a long history of conflict, with the two cities engaging in naval battles and fighting each other just about once a century until the Peloponnesian War.

- **Exception to the Norm**: This type of relationship was an exception to the norm, as most colonies maintained friendly ties with their mother city.

#### E. Expansion into the Mediterranean

The Greek world expanded further into the Mediterranean, with colonies established in Sicily, southern Italy, and North Africa. However, they were shut out from regions controlled by powerful empires, such as Egypt and Carthage.

- **Presence on Other Coasts**: The Greeks also had a presence on the coast of Spain and France, but these colonies were not as extensive or widespread.

#### F. Leading Colonizers

The leading colonizers included Miletus, Corinth, Megara, Euboea, and Chalcis, which sent out many colonies to different parts of the world.

- **Economic and Trade Motivations**: These cities were often located in areas with significant trade and industry, and their colonization efforts were driven by a desire for expansion and growth.
- **Consequences of Colonization**: The consequences of this phenomenon included the growth of commerce and trade, as well as the development of new social classes and economic systems.

#### G. Influence from Other Civilizations

The Greek experience was also influenced by their contact with other civilizations, such as Mesopotamia and Egypt.

- **Borrowing and Adaptation**: They borrowed ideas and knowledge from these cultures but adapted them in a way that was unique to themselves.
- **Emergence of a Distinct Civilization**: This led to the emergence of a distinct Greek civilization that was different from its predecessors.

#### H. Social and Economic Consequences

The growth of commerce and trade also had significant social and economic consequences, including the development of new classes and interests within the polis.

- **Shift in Power Dynamics**: As the hoplite farmers' way of life changes, they will no longer be content with deferring to their betters and leaving decisions to the aristocrats.
- **Pressure for Greater Participation**: Instead, they will demand greater participation in state decision-making, driven by pressure from within their own ranks.

#### I. The Role of Colonization as an Escape Valve

Colonization provides an escape valve for these tensions, allowing people who are unhappy with their circumstances to leave and settle in new places, much like the American frontier served as a safety valve for its own population.

- **Setting the Stage for Future Development**: As we approach the seventh century, these currents of change will continue to shape the towns and cities, setting the stage for the next phase of development.
