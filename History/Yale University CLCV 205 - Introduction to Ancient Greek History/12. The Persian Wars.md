### I. The End of Athenian Tyranny (527 BCE)

#### A. The Rule of Peisistratus' Sons

The Athenian tyranny, led by Peisistratus and his sons Hippeis and Hipparchus, came to an end in 527 with the peaceful death of Peisistratus. His sons succeeded him, ruling Athens with a moderate approach that maintained stability but also sparked opposition from aristocratic families. A personal quarrel between the tyrants and a noble young man led to a plot to kill both Hippeis and Hipparchus, which ultimately failed but marked a significant turning point in the regime's nature, becoming harsher and more oppressive.

#### B. The Exploitation of Favor with the Delphic Oracle

The Alcmaeonidae family, who had been driven out of Athens under Peisistratus' rule, sought to exploit their favor with the Delphic Oracle to drive Hippeis from power. King Cleomenes of Sparta was eventually called upon to invade Attica, gain control of the state, and remove Hippeis in 511-10.

### II. The Legacy of Athenian Tyranny

#### A. Economic Expansion and Aristocratic Power

The tyranny's legacy included a period of great economic expansion for Athens, as well as a diminution in the power of the aristocracy. However, this also led to a situation where people who had acquired citizenship under Solon were now being disenfranchised by Isagoras' council of three hundred.

#### B. The Rise of Cleisthenes and Democracy

Cleisthenes, leader of the Alcmaeonidae family and a proponent of democracy, broke with tradition by recruiting people beyond the aristocratic circle and proposing reforms that would establish what is considered the first Athenian democracy. He proposed laws in the assembly, which were passed despite opposition from Isagoras and King Cleomenes, who had driven out the Peisistratids but now sought to establish an aristocratic republic.

### III. The Reforms of Cleisthenes

#### A. The Creation of Ten New Tribes

The new democratic constitution was shaped in a hot environment of fear, with the Spartans potentially marching against Athens at any moment. The reforms included changes to the tribal system, creating ten new tribes with no tradition behind them, and dividing each tribe into three parts, or trittyes, geographically distributed across Attica.

#### B. The Division of Tribes into Trittyes

The Athenian constitution introduced by Cleisthenes aimed to create a more equal society by reducing the influence of birth and aristocratic power. The system was designed with ten tribes, each comprising citizens from various demes, which were meant to be numerically equal in population. This ensured that no single tribe or aristocrat could dominate the others.

#### C. The Council of 500

The demes were assigned to trittyes, but not randomly; they were carefully laid out to deprive noblemen of their undue influence and possibly to favor Cleisthenes' own political position. The system also introduced a council of 500, which was open to all Athenian adult male citizens and had the power to prepare legislation for the assembly.

#### D. The Reorganization of the Army

The army was reorganized with generals elected by the entire population, further reducing particularism and localism. Cleisthenes' reforms were supported by the hoplite class, independent farmers who made up a significant portion of the Athenian citizens.

### IV. The Principles of Athenian Democracy

#### A. Equality Before the Law (Eisonomia)

The Athenians called their constitution eisonomia, or equality before the law, which was a radical concept at the time. Equality of speech, isegoria, was also a key principle, allowing every Athenian male to address the assembly regardless of his social status.

#### B. The Limitations of Athenian Democracy

Despite its limitations, the Athenian democracy was revolutionary and had no precedent in the ancient world. In ancient Athens, when the number of ballots cast in an ostracism reached 6,000 or more, the person with the most votes was ostracized, meaning they had to leave Attica at a certain distance for ten years.

### V. Ostracism as a Constitutional Device

#### A. The Purpose of Ostracism

The purpose of ostracism was not to punish individuals for crimes, but rather to prevent potential coups d'Ã©tat, treason, or unrest by allowing citizens to vote on whether a leading figure should be removed from power.

#### B. Maintaining Stability and Deterrent Effect

This system was used as a constitutional device to maintain stability and deter internal hostility, particularly during the early days of democracy in Athens after Cleisthenes' reforms. The Athenians were afraid of internal betrayal and external threats from neighboring states, such as the Spartans, Corinthians, and others.

#### C. Preventing Internal Hostility

By allowing citizens to vote on ostracism, the government aimed to prevent a situation where a group of people might turn against the city or help invaders. Ostracism was not used to punish individuals for crimes, but rather to maintain stability and deter potential threats to democracy.
