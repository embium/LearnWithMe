### I. The Rise of Macedon and its Impact on Ancient Greece
#### A. Background: Philip II and the Macedonian Empire

The 4th century BC was a transformative period for ancient Greece, marked by significant changes in the concept of the independent polis. The Macedonians, who were fundamentally Greek but had developed differently from the mainstream Greek poleis, claimed to be Hellenes despite being considered an ethnos by other Greeks. Philip II, King of Macedon, rose to power in 359 BC and sought to demonstrate his greatness through conquests, including expanding the boundaries of Macedon and eventually conquering Greece.

Philip's military genius lay in creating a professional national army, which was a revolutionary development at the time. This army, comprising phalanx infantry, companion cavalry, and lighter infantry, was designed for complex battles and could adapt to different tactics. Philip's organizational skills allowed him to create this diverse force, which became the best army in the Greek world.

#### B. Conquests and Diplomacy

Philip's military prowess was complemented by his skillful diplomacy, using it as an extension of military forces by peaceful means. He was able to lie convincingly to advance his country's interests, often through strategic alliances or negotiations. Through a series of conquests, including taking Amphipolis and its gold and silver mines, Philip gained control of the northern Aegean Sea shoreline.

#### C. Conflict with Athens

Philip's expansion into Greece posed a significant threat to Athens, which had been weakened by its own internal conflicts and financial struggles. The Athenians were initially reluctant to engage with Philip, but as his power grew, they became increasingly concerned about the danger he presented. Demosthenes, a prominent Athenian leader, repeatedly warned the Athenians of the threat posed by Philip and urged them to take action against him.

#### D. The Sacred War and the Peace of Philocrates

The Sacred War, which broke out over Delphi, further complicated the situation, and Philip's increasing control of key territories made it difficult for Athens to resist his expansion. As tensions escalated, Demosthenes continued to advocate for a strong coalition against Philip, but ultimately, the Athenians were forced to make concessions to him through the Peace of Philocrates.

### II. The Role of Demosthenes in Ancient Greece
#### A. Advocacy and Leadership

Demosthenes played a crucial role in ancient Greek politics, advocating for a strong coalition against Philip's expansion. He repeatedly warned the Athenians of the threat posed by Philip and urged them to take action against him. Despite internal divisions within Athens, Demosthenes continued to push for a unified front against Macedon.

#### B. Diplomatic Efforts

Demosthenes made a crucial diplomatic move by forming an alliance with Thebes, which would have provided a strong ground force against Philip's forces. He also suggested using the theoric fund to supply the necessary forces. However, despite these efforts, the Battle of Chaeronea resulted in a victory for Philip, marking the end of Greek freedom.

#### C. Legacy and Debate

The debate over Demosthenes' actions in ancient Greece centered on whether he deserved a crown for his services to Athens or should be punished for his role in the defeat at Chaeronea. Some historians, like Droysen, viewed Demosthenes as a reactionary trying to preserve a bygone era. However, others have drawn parallels between Demosthenes and Winston Churchill, who also faced opposition for his efforts to rally support against tyranny.

### III. Historical Significance
#### A. The Establishment of the League of Corinth

Philip's subsequent conquests led to the establishment of the League of Corinth, effectively ending Athens' autonomy and forcing it to form an alliance with him. This event was seen as a turning point in history, marking the end of Greek freedom.

#### B. Parallels with Modern History

The story of Demosthenes and Philip's conflict has been compared to modern historical events, such as Winston Churchill's stand against Nazi Germany. Churchill's famous speech, which exhorted the British people to resist Nazi Germany, is often cited as an example of heroic defiance in the face of overwhelming odds. Similarly, Demosthenes' stand at Chaeronea may be seen as a courageous attempt to preserve Greek freedom, even if it ultimately failed.

#### C. Conclusion

The rise of Macedon and its impact on ancient Greece was a pivotal moment in history, marked by significant changes in the concept of the independent polis. The story of Philip's conquests and Demosthenes' advocacy serves as a reminder of the importance of leadership and diplomacy in shaping the course of human events.
