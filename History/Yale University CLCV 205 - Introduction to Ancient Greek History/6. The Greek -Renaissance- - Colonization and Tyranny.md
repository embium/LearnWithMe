### I. The Emergence of the Polis and Hoplite Warfare
#### A. Overview of the Hoplite Phalanx Formation

The emergence of the polis in ancient Greece marked a significant shift in warfare tactics, with the development of the heavily armed infantrymen fighting in a solid block formation known as the hoplite phalanx. This formation, which emerged around 700-650 B.C., consisted of eight rows deep of soldiers, each carrying a large shield and spear, with their right side protected by the left side of the soldier to their right.

#### B. Characteristics of the Hoplite Phalanx

The hoplites were trained to maintain a tight formation, with rhythm and music used to keep them in sync as they marched into battle. Once engaged, the phalanx would advance at a trot, with soldiers trying to knock each other back rather than killing individual opponents. The goal was not to kill but to get out of the way, allowing the next soldier behind to take their place.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Heavily armed infantrymen
    *   Solid block formation (phalanx)
    *   Eight rows deep
    *   Large shields and spears
    *   Rhythm and music used for synchronization

#### C. Effectiveness of the Hoplite Phalanx

The hoplite phalanx was effective against non-hoplite infantry forces, such as the Persians, who lacked the heavy armor and shields of the Greeks. However, when two hoplite phalanxes faced each other, the outcome was often determined by factors such as numbers, depth, and the ability to maintain formation under pressure.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Effective against non-hoplite infantry forces
    *   Protected flanks with shields locked together
    *   Objective: Break through enemy line and create a gap

#### D. Limitations of the Hoplite Phalanx

The phalanx formation made it difficult for an opposing army to flank its enemy, as this would create a gap in their own line, leaving them vulnerable to attack from behind. However, the Greeks did not engage in creative sneak attacks or use dirty tricks, preferring to adhere to traditional notions of honor and propriety.

*   **Limitations:**
    *   Difficult for opposing army to flank
    *   Limited mobility
    *   Created opportunities for enemy to exploit weaknesses

### II. The Nature of Hoplite Battles
#### A. Duration and Casualties

Hoplite battles were often brief, lasting only a few hours at most. Casualties could be high, with estimates suggesting up to 15% of the losing side's soldiers might be killed or wounded in a single engagement.

*   **Duration:**
    *   Brief battles (hours)
    *   High casualties (up to 15%)

#### B. Winning and Losing Sides

The winning side would usually claim victory by occupying the land where the battle took place, capturing enemy equipment, and burying their own dead. The losing side would typically request permission from the victors to retrieve their dead and perform a burial ritual.

*   **Winning Side:**
    *   Occupied land
    *   Captured enemy equipment
    *   Buried own dead

### III. Training and Tactics
#### A. Greek Military Training

The Greeks did not engage in extensive military training or practice, except for the Spartans, who made warfare a central part of their culture. As a result, individual heroism was rare, and battles were often decided by the skill of the generals rather than individual soldiers.

*   **Greek Military Training:**
    *   Limited training
    *   No extensive practice

#### B. Decision to Engage in Battle

The decision to charge or engage in battle was often determined by factors like access to resources, such as food or land, which could be used to weaken the opposing side.

*   **Decision to Engage:**
    *   Determined by resource availability
    *   Weaken opposing side
