### I. The Great Peloponnesian War: A Pivotal Event in Greek History
#### A. Background and Context

The Great Peloponnesian War was a devastating conflict that took place from 431 to 404 BCE between the Athenian Empire and the Spartan alliance. This war marked a critical turning point in Greek history, causing immense destruction of life and property, intensifying factional and class hostility, and dividing the Greek states internally. The war also had far-reaching consequences for the civilization of the Greeks and the world at large.

The period leading up to the war was characterized by a great age of Greece from 479 to 431 BCE, during which many of the things that we value in Greek experience were created and carried forward. However, this confidence and hope were ultimately shattered by the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.

#### B. Causes and Origins of the War

The war was sparked by a quarrel between two Spartan allies, Megara and Corinth, which escalated into a full-scale conflict when Athens took Megara's side and built long walls connecting the city to the port of Nicea. This decision ultimately led to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BCE.

The Athenians' decision to tackle another war against the Persians was likely driven by overconfidence and a desire to assert their dominance. However, this arrogance was eventually met with a response from the Spartans, who took an army to central Greece to deal with the Dorian problem.

#### C. Key Events and Battles

The war saw several significant battles and events, including:

* The Battle of Tanagra: Although the Spartans technically won the battle, it was largely a standoff, and their strategic consequences were minimal.
* The Athenian victory at Oenophyta: This marked a significant moment in Athenian history, as they had achieved complete security from their northwestern frontier and control of the seas.
* The loss of ships in Egypt: This led to a rash of rebellions in the Delian League, and the Athenians were occupied with trying to put them down.
* The Spartans' attack on Phocis: The Athenians responded by sending an army and retaking it for the Phocians.

#### D. The Thirty-Years Peace

The war was eventually brought to a close by the thirty-years peace concluded over the winter of 446-445 BCE. This treaty marked a significant moment in Athenian history, as they had achieved complete security from their northwestern frontier and control of the seas. However, this peace would eventually come under strain, leading to further conflicts between Athens and Sparta.

The arrangements of this peace included:

* Athens giving up all its holdings on the continent outside the Aegean Sea, except Naupactus.
* Rules meant to prevent the outbreak of war in the future, including a clause that prohibited allies from changing sides and another that allowed neutrals to join either side without causing a war.
* A provision for arbitration, where disagreements between the two signatories would be submitted to an arbitrator for a decision.

#### E. Legacy and Impact

The Great Peloponnesian War had far-reaching consequences for the civilization of the Greeks and the world at large. It marked the end of a period of confidence and hope in Greece, which had been characterized by the great age of Greece from 479 to 431 BCE.

Thucydides' account of the war is considered one of the greatest works of history ever written, and his way of thinking about history, war, international relations, and human behavior has had a profound influence on Western thought. The war also drew in other peoples, including the Persians, Macedonians, Sicilians, and Italians, making it a kind of world war.

The legacy of the Great Peloponnesian War continues to be studied and debated by scholars today, with many arguing that human intentions and feelings about the peace played a crucial role in its success or failure.
