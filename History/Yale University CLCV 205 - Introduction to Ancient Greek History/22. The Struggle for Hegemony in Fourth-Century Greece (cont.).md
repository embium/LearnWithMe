### I. The Persian Wars and Greek Politics (401-379 BCE)

#### A. Background: The Expedition of 10,000 Greeks

In 401 BCE, Prince Cyrus, a younger son of the Persian King Artaxerxes, sought to overthrow his older brother and gain the throne. He hired a large army of Greek mercenaries, including an Athenian cavalryman named Xenophon, who would later write about their experiences in "The Anabasis." However, Cyrus was killed, and the expedition's purpose was lost. The 10,000 Greek hoplites were left to fight their way out of the Persian Empire, electing new generals and eventually making it back to the Black Sea. This event planted the idea in many Greeks' minds that the Persian Empire was vulnerable and could be invaded.

#### B. The Peloponnesian War and Its Aftermath

The expedition of 10,000 Greeks was a consequence of the Peloponnesian War, which had uprooted people and impoverished many. The Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor were still under dispute, with the Spartans having agreed to Persian control in treaties but Lysander not seeing any reason to carry out these promises. Tissaphernes attacked these cities, which turned to Sparta for help. In 400-399 BCE, the Spartans sent an army under Thibron, who recruited 6,000 of the original mercenaries and 5,000 Peloponnesians.

#### C. The Corinthian War (395-386 BCE)

The Spartans' fleet was defeated by Conon, a Persian admiral, who captured the island of Rhodes and established a democracy there. The Spartans responded by increasing their navy to meet this challenge, but were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Cnidus in 394 BCE. This defeat led to the withdrawal of Spartan forces from Asia and marked the end of Sparta's aggressive policy overseas.

The Corinthian War broke out in 395-386 BCE, sparked by Sparta's tyrannical behavior towards other Greek cities. The war engaged all major Greek cities and was caused by a combination of factors, including grievances from the Peloponnesian War, Spartan arrogance, and the Persians' support for a coalition against Sparta.

#### D. Key Events and Consequences

*   **The Battle of Nemea (394 BC)**: The Spartans technically won but failed to achieve strategic consequences.
*   **Iphicrates' Victory**: The Athenians used light-armed troops under Iphicrates, who successfully defeated a Spartan division and demonstrated the effectiveness of this type of warfare.
*   **The Battle of Cnidus (394 BC)**: Conon's victory allowed Athens to regain control of the Aegean Sea and rebuild its naval power.

#### E. The King's Peace and Its Aftermath

The war ultimately ended with the Spartans negotiating a peace treaty with Persia, known as the King's Peace, which favored Sparta and led to the dissolution of the Boeotian League, the splitting of Argos and Corinth, and Athens losing control of Lemnos, Imbros, and Skyros. The treaty marked a significant reversal of the Persian Wars, where Greece had defeated Persia, and instead saw Persia dictating terms to Greece.

#### F. Spartan Hegemony and the Rise of the Second Athenian Confederation

The Spartans then used their newfound power to attack Mantinea in 385 BC and Phlyus in 383 BC, demonstrating their ability to exert control over other city-states. The King's Peace was meant to uphold Greek autonomy, but the Spartans' actions in Thebes and Boeotia undermined this principle.

In 382-379 BCE, a Spartan force led by Phoebidas seized the Acropolis of Thebes on a sacred day, killing opponents of the oligarchic government that had invited them. This was not sanctioned by the Spartan assembly, but when Phoebidas returned to Sparta, he was acquitted and even praised for his actions.

The garrison left in Thebes remained, further antagonizing the Greek world. In 379 BCE, a group of exiles from Thebes launched a successful plot to kill the oligarchic leaders and drive out the Spartans, freeing the city and establishing a democratic government.

Meanwhile, a Spartan harmost named Sphodrias led a nighttime raid into Attica, causing damage but failing to reach Athens. He was acquitted on the grounds that Sparta had too few men of quality to execute justice. The Athenians, who had been holding Spartan ambassadors as hostages, were outraged and began organizing an alliance against Sparta, which would eventually become the Second Athenian Confederation and a threat to the Spartan hegemony.

#### G. Conclusion

The Persian Wars and Greek politics during this period were marked by significant events that shaped the course of history. The expedition of 10,000 Greeks, the Peloponnesian War, and the Corinthian War all contributed to the rise and fall of various city-states and empires. The King's Peace and its aftermath had far-reaching consequences for Greece, leading to a shift in power dynamics and the eventual emergence of new alliances and conflicts.

This period also saw the development of new military tactics and strategies, such as the use of light-armed troops under Iphicrates. The actions of key figures like Phoebidas and Sphodrias further complicated the political landscape, leading to a series of events that would ultimately shape the course of Greek history.

Overall, this period was marked by significant upheaval and transformation in Greece, with far-reaching consequences for the region's politics, economy, and society.
