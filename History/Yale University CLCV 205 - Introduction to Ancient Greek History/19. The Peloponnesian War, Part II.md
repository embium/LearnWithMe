### I. The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War
#### A. Background and Escalating Tensions

The Peloponnesian War was a culmination of years of escalating tensions between Athens and Sparta. One of the key events that contributed to this conflict was the Athenians' decision to form an alliance with Corcyra, a city-state in northwest Greece. However, instead of accepting or rejecting the traditional offensive and defensive alliance offered by the Corcyraeans, the Athenians made a purely defensive alliance. This move was seen as a diplomatic gesture to avoid changing the balance of naval power.

The Corinthians attacked Corcyra at the Battle of Sybota, prompting the Athenians to send a fleet of ten ships with orders not to engage unless the Corinthians were about to win and land on the island. However, when the Corinthians panicked upon seeing the Athenian ships approaching, they withdrew from the battle, leaving things up in the air.

#### B. The Corcyraean Affair and Its Consequences

The Corinthians continued to press for action against Athens, citing the Corcyraean affair as one of their grievances. In response, the Athenians passed a decree that forbade the Megarians from trading with them. This move was intended to deter other Peloponnesian allies from following suit but ultimately contributed to the growing tensions between Athens and Sparta.

The Corinthians pressed their case against Athens at a meeting of the Spartan assembly, where they made a speech that painted a picture of an insatiable Athenian state that would always be a menace to its neighbors. The Athenians responded with a speech that suggested war would not be easy for the Spartans and that they were prepared to submit to arbitration as required by the treaty.

#### C. The Spartan Decision to Go to War

Despite these efforts, the Spartans voted in favor of going to war against Athens, with a clear majority. The delay between the vote and the actual start of the war was likely due to the heat of anger generated by the Corinthian argument and other complaints from their allies.

The Spartans did not immediately march into Attica to fight the Athenians but instead waited until March 431 to fulfill their decision. The Peloponnesian War began when the Spartans sent a mission to Athens demanding that they withdraw their troops from Potidaea, leave Aegina autonomous, and rescind the Megarian Decree. The Athenians refused, leading to a series of diplomatic efforts by both sides.

#### D. The Role of Pericles

Pericles argued that giving in on the point of withdrawing the Megarian Decree would embolden the Spartans and undermine Athenian power. He maintained that the Spartans were not to be trusted and that their behavior was unacceptable. The Athenians ultimately refused to withdraw the decree, setting the course for war.

The conflict began when the Thebans attacked Plataea, a town allied with Athens, in 431 BC. This attack led to the involvement of both sides, with the Spartans eventually invading Attica and starting the war.

### II. The Causes of the Peloponnesian War
#### A. Misconceptions about the Megarian Decree

The notion that the Megarian Decree was the cause of the Peloponnesian War and that Pericles was responsible for it is a common but oversimplified view, which has been largely discredited by historians. Thucydides, in his account of the war's origins, gives little attention to the decree and its supposed significance, instead presenting it as one of many specific quarrels that he regards as insignificant.

#### B. The Role of Fear and Misunderstanding

The Spartans' decision not to arbitrate was driven by their fear that it would undermine their power and security within the Peloponnesian League. Similarly, the Athenians refused to back down due to their own fears and misunderstandings about how the war would be fought.

Pericles' strategy of deterrence relied on the Spartans believing they could not harm Athens without suffering significant consequences, but this proved to be a flawed assumption. The war itself was marked by a series of complex events and decisions made by both sides, ultimately leading to the devastation of Greece.

### III. Thucydides' Account of the War's Origins
#### A. Critique of the Athenian Democracy

Thucydides' statement in Book II, Chapter 5, that Athens was a democracy in name but ruled by the first citizen in fact is widely disputed among historians. This view is often compared to Augustus' claim of ruling through auctoritas rather than potestas, which is seen as a flat lie given his actual monopoly on power and resources.

In contrast, Pericles had no armed forces at his disposal and was subject to the assembly's approval for any use of force, with charges against him being brought and debated in court. Thucydides' statement about Pericles is likely an attempt to justify his own criticism of the Athenian democracy, which he expressed during his exile from 424 onwards.

#### B. The Significance of Thucydides' Account

Thucydides' account of the war's origins has convinced most readers over the centuries, despite some criticisms and disputes among historians. His sweeping revision of the usual explanation presents a nuanced understanding of the complex events leading up to the Peloponnesian War.

### IV. Conclusion
The outbreak of the Peloponnesian War was a culmination of years of escalating tensions between Athens and Sparta. The war itself was marked by a series of complex events and decisions made by both sides, ultimately leading to the devastation of Greece.
