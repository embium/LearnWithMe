### I. The Emergence of Greek Tyranny (7th century B.C.)

#### A. Origins and Definition of Tyranny

The concept of Greek tyranny emerged as a response to societal changes in the seventh century B.C., including colonization, economic shifts, and the rise of new social classes. The word "tyranny" originates from the Lydian king Gyges (685-657 B.C.), who ruled without traditional Greek constitutional norms. Initially, tyrants were viewed as illegitimate rulers due to their lack of responsibility and accountability.

In contrast to kings, who were seen as legitimate rulers, tyrants were associated with hubris â€“ the arrogant exercise of power. The Greeks saw tyranny as a deviation from the normal way things happened in society, where traditional norms and values were respected. The first tyrant mentioned in Greek tradition is Pheidon of Argos, who led his army to victories against Sparta and established Argos as the dominant force in the Peloponnesus.

#### B. Connection between Hoplite Armies and Tyranny

The rise of tyranny in Greece is often linked to the development of the hoplite army and the need for military force to break the monopoly of power held by the old aristocracy. The hoplite phalanx, led by Pheidon, brought about a new kind of state with a new constitution. This connection is further supported by the fact that early Greek colonies were often founded by towns with commercial activity, such as Argos, Corinth, and nearby towns.

The emergence of tyrannies in cities like Corinth, Sicyon, and Megara was a significant phenomenon during a period of rapid population growth, social change, and economic development. Powerful individuals seized control through various means, often with the support of hoplite armies or mercenaries. These tyrants, such as Cypselus in Corinth and Orthagoras in Sicyon, relied on personal qualities like charisma, military skill, and wealth to establish their rule.

#### C. Characteristics of Tyrannies

Tyrannies were characterized by significant economic prosperity, with diversified economies that supported trade, industry, and agriculture. Many tyrants fostered colonization, which brought new benefits to the community. They also introduced urbanization, creating central places in cities called agoras, which served as commercial centers, civic spaces, and sometimes even religious sites.

Tyrants invested heavily in public buildings, including temples made of stone, which were a novelty at the time. These structures had a profound impact on the communities they served, becoming iconic symbols of power and wealth. The tyrants also patronized the arts, supporting architects, sculptors, painters, poets, and other entertainers.

#### D. Impact and Legacy of Tyranny

While the old aristocrats opposed the tyrannies, many ordinary citizens were initially pleased with the positive changes brought about by these rulers. However, as time passed, concerns about the erosion of traditional values and autonomy grew, particularly among hoplite farmers who valued their independence and self-governance.

The concept of tyranny has long been a source of conflict in societies, as people struggle with being told what to do while also recognizing the achievements of those who have held power. Historically, tyrannies have declined in popularity from generation to generation, with their founders often remaining popular until their death, but subsequent leaders losing favor due to their personal shortcomings.

The overthrow of a tyranny typically leads to an oligarchy, where wealthy and influential individuals hold power, but this is soon followed by factionalism and competition among these groups. However, the hoplite class of independent farmers has played a crucial role in many regimes, providing economic stability and participating in political life. In some cases, such as Athens, this has led to the development of democracy, where every adult male citizen has significant political rights.

#### E. Greek Perception of Tyranny

The Greeks consistently viewed tyranny as arbitrary, violent, and oppressive, with tyrants seen as arrogant and unwilling to permit free speech. This negative view is reflected in the works of Herodotus, Aeschylus, and Plato, who all saw tyranny as a threat to freedom and democracy.

In Greek thought, tyranny was considered an unnatural way of life for free men, but rather a natural state for barbarians, who were seen as slaves by nature. This ethnocentric view held that only those living in a polis could be truly free, while those under the rule of monarchs or tyrants were naturally enslaved.

### II. Conclusion

The emergence of Greek tyranny marked a significant turning point in ancient Greek history, driven by societal changes and the rise of new social classes. The connection between hoplite armies and tyranny highlights the complex interplay between military power, economic development, and political change. As we reflect on the legacy of tyranny, it is essential to consider its impact on societies, the role of ordinary citizens in shaping their own destinies, and the ongoing struggle for freedom and democracy.
