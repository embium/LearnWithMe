### I. The Rise of the Persian Empire
#### A. Expansion Under Cyrus the Great

The rise of the Persian Empire marked a significant turning point in ancient history, as it expanded its territories under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. Born around 600 BCE, Cyrus was a member of the royal family of Anshan, a small kingdom in modern-day Iran. He rose to power after leading a successful rebellion against his uncle, King Astyages of Media, and eventually conquered the Medes, Babylon, Armenia, Syria, Cappadocia, and Lydia.

Cyrus' military campaigns were characterized by their speed and efficiency, allowing him to expand his empire rapidly. One notable example is the conquest of Lydia, which was led by King Croesus, a wealthy and powerful ruler who had previously attempted to conquer the Persian Empire but was defeated. The fall of Lydia marked a significant milestone in the expansion of the Persian Empire, as it gained control over Mesopotamia and eventually Egypt.

By 522 BCE, the Persian Empire stretched from the Aegean Sea to the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan, and from the Mediterranean to the Hellespont and the European coast of the Aegean Sea. This vast expansion had significant implications for the ancient world, as it created a powerful empire that would shape the course of history.

#### B. The Impact on Greek City-States

The rise of the Persian Empire also had a profound impact on Greek city-states, which were left to their own devices after the clash between the Persian Empire and some Greek city-states. Athens, in particular, was establishing its new Cleisthenic regime, characterized by equality of speech and autonomy. However, this new regime faced threats from within and outside, including a Spartan invasion that was eventually thwarted due to internal divisions among the Spartans.

The Athenians then sent a mission to Persia, asking for an alliance, but were rebuffed when they were asked to surrender their democracy and install a tyranny. This rejection marked a significant turning point in the relationship between Athens and Persia, as it led to increased tensions and eventually the outbreak of war.

### II. The Ionian Rebellion
#### A. Background and Causes

The Ionian rebellion against Persia began in 499 BC, with Athens and Eretria leading the charge. The Athenians were motivated by a desire to help their relatives in Ionia, as well as a fear of Persian interference with their trade interests. The rebellion was sparked by Aristagoras' desire for power and wealth, but it also reflected the growing discontent among the Greeks with their subjugation to the Persians.

The Ionian cities, led by Miletus, began to rebel against Persian rule under the leadership of Aristagoras, who had previously attempted to conquer Naxos. The rebellion was marked by a series of battles and skirmishes between the Greeks and the Persians, with the Athenians sending a fleet and soldiers to assist the Ionian cities.

#### B. The Battle of Lade

The Persian fleet, aided by Phoenician and Egyptian contingents, defeated the Greek fleet at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC, putting down the rebellion. The Persians then took vengeance on Miletus, burning it to the ground. This marked a significant defeat for the Greeks, as they were unable to withstand the might of the Persian Empire.

### III. The Athenian Response
#### A. Preparations for War

The Athenians were troubled by these events, knowing that they would be punished for their actions against Persia. In 496-5 BC, Hipparchus, a relative of the Peisistratids, was elected archon, despite being allegedly targeted by ostracism. This has been interpreted as evidence that Cleisthenes' regime was still in power and that Hipparchus had joined forces with him.

In 493 BC, Phrynicus presented his play "The Capture of Miletus," which showed the destruction of Miletus by the Persians. The Athenians were so moved by this performance that they fined Phrynicus heavily for causing them such distress. This has been seen as an attempt to raise anger against the Persians and prepare Athens for war.

#### B. The Election of Miltiades

Miltiades, who had betrayed the king of Persia, returned to Athens in 493 BC and was likely anti-Persian due to his circumstances. His election as archon may have been a sign that the Athenians were increasingly unwilling to accept Persian rule and were ready to fight against it.

### IV. The Battle of Marathon
#### A. Background and Context

The Persians, led by Datis and Artaphernes, invaded Greece with an army of around 25,000 infantrymen and some cavalry. They landed at Marathon, which was chosen for its proximity to Eretria and its suitability for cavalry battles. The Athenians, who had been warned of the invasion, marched out from Athens and went to Marathon, where they debated what to do next.

Some favored defending the city of Athens, but this would have allowed the Persians to run amok in Attica, causing significant harm to the Athenian population. Others suggested sending an army to meet the Persians at the place of landing. Miltiades emerged as a leading figure in this debate and proposed that they send an army to Marathon to confront the Persians.

#### B. The Battle

The Spartans, who had promised to help the Athenians but were unable to do so due to their religious ceremony, the Carnea, ultimately did not arrive at Marathon until after the battle was over. The Athenian army, led by Miltiades, marched out from Athens and went to Marathon, where they engaged the Persians in a fierce battle on August 4th, 490 BC.

The Battle of Marathon was a pivotal moment in ancient Greek history, where a small force of Greeks, led by a general with significant influence, successfully defended their country against the invading Persian army. The Persians, numbering around 25,000 infantry, were vastly outnumbered by the Greeks, who had about 10,000 troops, but they lacked unity and heavy armor, unlike the Greek hoplites.

#### C. Aftermath

The victory at Marathon had far-reaching consequences, boosting Greek morale and pride, and cementing Athens' reputation as a bastion of democracy. The significance of Marathon lies not only in its military outcome but also in its impact on Western civilization, as it prevented the stranglehold of slavery and allowed for the development of democracy, science, and art that would shape the course of human history.
