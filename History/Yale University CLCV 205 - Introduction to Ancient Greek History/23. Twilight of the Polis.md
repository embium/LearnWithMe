### I. The Rise of Theban Hegemony
#### A. Background and Context

The Spartans' attempt to extend their hegemony after the Peloponnesian War led to a restoration of Athens as an independent state capable of opposing them. Meanwhile, Thebes emerged as a third great power in Greece, never previously having held a position of equality with leading powers. This marked a significant shift in the balance of power in ancient Greece.

#### B. Theban Hegemony (379-371 BCE)

The period of growth in power, influence, wealth, and extent for Thebes began around 379 BCE, when they launched a successful rebellion against Spartan rule. This was followed by the reconstruction of the Boeotian League to make it more democratic. The Thebans' ability to gather strength, recover parts of Boeotia, and drive the Spartans away without yielding anything important contributed significantly to their success.

#### C. Key Factors in Theban Success

- **Hoplite Equipment for Farmers**: The Thebans managed to increase the size of their army by equipping poorer farmers with hoplite equipment, creating a powerful force that played a crucial role in the Battle of Leuctra.
- **Democratic Regime and Nationalism**: The Thebans' democratic regime and sense of nationalism contributed to their morale and enthusiasm, making them formidable military powers.

### II. The Battle of Leuctra (371 BCE)
#### A. Overview

The Battle of Leuctra marked a significant turning point in Greek history, as Thebes, led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, defeated the Spartans, shattering their supremacy. This battle was not just a military triumph but also a strategic one, as the Thebans bypassed the Spartan city, ravaging the countryside and destroying the myth of Spartan invincibility.

#### B. Key Aspects of the Battle

- **Theban Strategy**: Epaminondas aimed to humiliate the Spartans, much like William Tecumseh Sherman's march through Georgia during the American Civil War.
- **Psychological Impact**: The Thebans' actions had a profound psychological impact on the Spartans, rendering them unable to regain control over the Peloponnesus.

### III. Aftermath and Consequences
#### A. Decline of Spartan Power

The victory at Leuctra set off a chain reaction, leading to the eventual decline of Spartan power and the rise of other city-states, including Athens. Sparta emerged as an independent city but never regained its former status as a dominant power in Greece.

#### B. Rise of Other City-States

The Arcadians, who had suffered under Spartan rule, also joined forces with the Thebans, further solidifying their hold on central and northern Greece. This led to a shift in the balance of power in ancient Greece, paving the way for future conflicts and external threats.

#### C. External Threats and Unpredictability of History

The Greeks' failure to recognize these dangers at the time underscores the unpredictability of history and the importance of learning from past experiences. The vulnerability of Greece ultimately led to exploitation by external threats, such as Macedonia, which would become a real menace within a few decades.

### IV. Legacy and Lessons
#### A. Epaminondas' Legacy

Epaminondas' legacy was not about expanding Thebes' power or making its name legendary, but rather about restoring the Mycenaeans to their land and giving them freedom. His pride in freeing all of Greece, despite the imperfections of his achievement, highlights the complexities of war and its aftermath.

#### B. Xenophon's Account

Xenophon's account of the Battle of Mantinea highlights the futility of war, where both sides claimed victory yet nothing was settled, and Greece remained weakened and divided. This vulnerability underscores the importance of learning from past experiences and recognizing the dangers that lie ahead.
