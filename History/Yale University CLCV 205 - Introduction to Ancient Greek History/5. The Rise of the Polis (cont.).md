### I. The Concept of the Polis in Ancient Greece
#### A. Overview of the Polis

The concept of the polis in ancient Greece was distinct from other city-states due to its emphasis on justice, community, and the well-being of citizens. This unique blend of values is reflected in the works of Hesiod and Solon, who described the importance of justice and the consequences of violating it. The Greeks believed that a good life could only be achieved through living in a polis, where one's behavior had consequences for the entire community.

#### B. The Role of Justice and Community

The notion that a polis can shape the character of its citizens is central to Greek thought. According to Hesiod, those who follow the path of righteousness are rewarded with prosperity, peace, and freedom from disasters, while those who do not are punished by Zeus. This idea was revolutionary for its time, as it placed responsibility on the state to make good men rather than simply preventing wrongdoing.

#### C. The Emergence of Democracy

The growth of democracy in some city-states marked a significant shift in the political landscape of ancient Greece. However, despite this emergence, the typical polis remained an oligarchy, with wealthier citizens participating in politics and decision-making, while poorer citizens were excluded. This exclusion was partly due to the rise of slavery, which accompanied the development of family farms (oikos) and allowed wealthy landowners to use slaves for labor-intensive tasks.

#### D. The Significance of the Oikos

The oikos, or self-sufficient household, played a crucial role in the emergence and development of the polis. This concept is tied to the importance of family units in ancient Greek society, where individuals took initiative and responsibility for their own well-being. The expertise developed through farming allowed them to cultivate excellent wine and olive oil, as well as fruit trees that produced very well.

#### E. The Impact on Society and Values

The invention of the family farm marked a critical moment in human history, with its impact on society, values, and attitudes still evident today. As farmers developed new skills and technologies, they began to demand a larger voice in government, leading to changes in the political landscape of ancient Greece.

### II. The Emergence of the Polis
#### A. Overview of the Emergence

The collapse of the palace civilization led to a decline in population, poverty, and starvation during the Dark Ages. However, with the emergence of family farms (oikos), stability was achieved through private land ownership, allowing for investment in soil improvement and crop diversification.

#### B. The Development of Agriculture

The ancient Mediterranean civilization was rather advanced in terms of agricultural skill, with knowledge of techniques for grafting, improving, and domesticating species of grapes and olives. This expertise allowed them to cultivate excellent wine and olive oil, as well as fruit trees that produced very well.

#### C. Internal Colonization and the Growth of Slavery

The growth of slavery accompanied this shift, as wealthy landowners used slaves for labor-intensive tasks. The typical polis remained an oligarchy, with wealthier citizens participating in politics and decision-making, while poorer citizens were excluded.
