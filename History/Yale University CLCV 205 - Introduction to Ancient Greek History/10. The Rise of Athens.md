### I. Governance and Politics in Ancient Sparta
#### A. Overview of the Spartan System

The Spartans developed a unique system of governance that blended elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The formal constitution consisted of kings, a gerousia (council of elders), and an assembly of all adult male citizens. However, this system was not as democratic as it seemed, with the average Spartan citizen rarely participating in the assembly.

#### B. The Role of the Ephors

The ephors played a crucial role in overseeing the kings and ensuring they didn't abuse their power. These officials were ordinary citizens chosen through a combination of election and sortition, rather than distinguished individuals with clout. They were responsible for foreign policy, often dealing with neighboring states and deciding whether to go to war or make alliances.

#### C. The Peloponnesian League

The Spartans' expansionist policies led them to establish the Peloponnesian League, a coalition of states that allowed them to gain more troops for their army without having to conquer new territories. This system enabled Sparta to become a hegemonal power in Greece, respected by other city-states and able to lead the Greek league against the Persians.

#### D. Foreign Policy and Military Prowess

Despite their military prowess, the Spartans were reluctant to fight wars, especially those that required them to be away from home for long periods. Their primary motivation was the fear of Helot rebellions, which they had been dealing with for centuries. The Spartans also worried about corruption and external threats, such as the permanent enmity of Argos.

#### E. Instability within the State

The Spartan state was characterized by conservatism in foreign policy, with war being a means to acquire booty and prestige. However, this led to instability within the state, as individuals gained excessive honor and a sense of their own greatness.

### II. Governance and Politics in Ancient Athens
#### A. Overview of Athenian Society

Athenian society was initially aristocratic, with the well-born (eupatrids) dominating the best farmland, government, and religion. However, as Athens grew in power and wealth, new classes emerged, including the hippeis (cavalrymen), thetes (poor), and zeugitai (independent farmers).

#### B. The Rise of Solon

These changes set the stage for future developments, including the rise of Solon, who would play a significant role in shaping Athenian society.

#### C. The Alcmaeonidae Family

A young leader attempted to establish a tyranny in Athens, just as his father-in-law had done in Megara. He was resisted by the Alcmaeonidae family, who led the opposition and eventually defeated him. This event marked a turning point for the Alcmaeonidae, as they were declared accursed and driven from the city.

#### D. The Curse of the Alcmaeonidae

The failed coup attempt suggests that the forces driving tyranny in other cities had not yet reached Athens, but it serves as a warning of troubles ahead. This curse would later be used against Pericles, who was related to the Alcmaeonidae through his mother.

### III. Comparison and Contrast
#### A. Differences between Spartan and Athenian Governance

The Spartans developed a unique system of governance that blended elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, while Athens developed into a naval state with a strong economy. The two city-states had different motivations for their foreign policies, with Sparta focusing on maintaining stability at home and Athens seeking to expand its power and influence.

#### B. Implications for Future Developments

The differences in governance between Sparta and Athens would have significant implications for future developments in ancient Greece. The rise of Solon and the Alcmaeonidae family would play a crucial role in shaping Athenian society, while the Spartan system would lead to instability within the state.
