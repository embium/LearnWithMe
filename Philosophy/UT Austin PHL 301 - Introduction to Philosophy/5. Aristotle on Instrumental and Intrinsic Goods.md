### I. Aristotle's Ethics Approach
#### A. Overview of Aristotle's System

Aristotle's ethics approach remains widely influential today, with approximately one-quarter of contemporary ethicists identifying as Aristotelian and adopting his basic principles. His system begins with a fundamental distinction between instrumental goods and intrinsic values.

#### B. Instrumental Goods vs. Intrinsic Values
- **Instrumental goods** are things valued for their ability to achieve something else.
- Examples include money, tools, medicine, education, which are often pursued as means to an end rather than ends in themselves.
- In contrast, **intrinsic values** like the truth, personal growth, and happiness are cherished for their own sake, regardless of any potential benefits or consequences.

#### C. Aristotle's Concept of Happiness (Eudaimonia)
Aristotle argues that there is one thing that is always desired for its own sake and never for the sake of something else: **happiness**. He claims that people choose happiness above all else, and it is the ultimate goal of human life.
- However, he also acknowledges that many things, such as virtue, morality, security, and meaning, are valued both for their own sake and as means to achieve happiness.
- Aristotle's concept of **eudaimonia** encompasses a broad range of values, including living well, flourishing, and thriving. It is not merely a fleeting emotional state but rather a long-term condition that reflects the overall quality of one's life.

#### D. Living Well: A Broad View
To live well would involve:
- Having good relationships, friends, and loved ones.
- Achieving personal goals and feeling a sense of purpose.
- Being charitable and contributing positively to the lives of others.
- Experiencing fulfilling moments and being memorable.
- Valuing justice, fairness, and knowledge as essential components of living well.

#### E. The Role of Happiness in Living Well
Aristotle suggests that happiness contributes to all these things, requiring a combination of internal virtues and external factors such as material comfort and good fortune.
- However, even with the best intentions and efforts, external circumstances can sometimes cooperate poorly, making it difficult for some people to feel they have lived well.

#### F. The Purpose or Function of Human Beings
Ultimately, the question remains: what is it to be a good person and live well? Aristotle proposes that living well involves fulfilling one's function, but the deeper question of what the purpose or function of human beings is still needs to be considered.
- This will be explored further in future discussions.
