### I. Plato's Ethics: An Overview
#### A. The Unity of Virtues in Early Dialogues

Plato's early dialogues, particularly those featuring Socrates, present a view of virtue as the unity of virtues. This idea is rooted in the notion that all virtues come down to knowing good and evil. In these dialogues, Socrates does not directly advocate for his own views but rather critiques the definitions put forward by others, suggesting that his perspectives are reflected in the background.

- **Key Concept:** The unity of virtues implies that all virtues are interconnected and ultimately stem from a deeper understanding of what is good and evil.
- **Example:** In dialogues such as Euthyphro and Charmides, Socrates engages with interlocutors who propose various definitions of virtue. Through his questioning, he reveals the flaws in these definitions, hinting at a more comprehensive view of virtue.

#### B. The Middle Dialogues: A Shift in Perspective

In contrast to the early dialogues, Plato's middle period, including The Republic, presents Socrates advocating for positions and not just critiquing others' views. This shift suggests that Plato is actively exploring different ideas about ethics and virtue.

- **Key Concept:** In The Republic, Socrates discusses the nature of justice and argues that it is a fundamental aspect of human society.
- **Example:** The dialogue explores the idea of the tripartite soul, where reason, emotion, and desire are distinct components that can come into conflict with one another. This concept has had significant influence on philosophical discussions about human nature and morality.

#### C. Later Dialogues: Distancing from Socrates' Views

In Plato's later dialogues, Socrates either becomes a mouthpiece for Plato or disappears entirely. This shift has led scholars to believe that Plato is distancing himself from Socrates' opinions, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of virtue and ethics.

- **Key Concept:** The concept of weakness of will emerges as a central theme in these later dialogues, where individuals struggle with internal conflicts between reason and desire.
- **Example:** In the dialogue Phaedrus, Plato explores the idea that individuals can know what is right but fail to act on it due to temptation or other factors. This raises questions about the nature of virtue and how it relates to knowledge.

### II. Virtue as Knowing Good and Evil
#### A. The Implication of Knowledge

The concept of virtue as knowing good and evil implies that one cannot be virtuous without having this knowledge. However, this raises questions about whether one can exhibit virtue without actually doing it or if one can know what to do without being virtuous.

- **Key Concept:** This idea is central to Plato's ethics and has significant implications for understanding the nature of virtue.
- **Example:** The marshmallow test illustrates how individuals struggle with delayed gratification, highlighting the difficulty in comparing short-term and long-term goods. Socrates argues that this inability is a form of ignorance that can lead to weakness of will.

#### B. Overcoming Temptation

The question then becomes how to promote a greater ability to make these comparisons and overcome temptation. This will be a key focus in Plato's mature theory, as he seeks to understand the nature of virtue and how it relates to human psychology.

- **Key Concept:** The concept of conflict within oneself has been a longstanding philosophical debate, with various thinkers offering their perspectives on the matter.
- **Example:** According to Socrates, virtue is knowledge and vice is ignorance. However, Plato proposed a different view in his Republic, arguing that when faced with temptation, individuals experience psychological conflict due to conflicting desires within themselves.

### III. Conflict Within Oneself
#### A. The Tripartite Soul

Plato's concept of the tripartite soul suggests that reason, emotion, and desire are three distinct components that can come into conflict with one another. He used the metaphor of a chariot to illustrate this idea, where reason is the driver and emotion and desire are the unruly horses that must be controlled.

- **Key Concept:** This concept has been influential in shaping philosophical discussions on human nature and morality.
- **Example:** The notion of conflict as a struggle between different parts of the soul was further developed by Plato, who argued that individuals with willpower resist their desires, while those weak of will give in to them, leading to an internal war.

#### B. Critique and Fragmentation

Augustine later critiqued Plato's view, arguing that if we accept the principle that internal conflict indicates multiple parts of the soul, then it follows that there could be thousands of such parts, as desires, emotions, and even rational conclusions can come into conflict with one another.

- **Key Concept:** This critique challenges the idea that individuals are psychologically unified and instead suggests a more fragmented understanding of human nature.
- **Example:** The concept of internal conflict has been debated by philosophers throughout history, with various perspectives on its implications for ethics and morality.
