### I. The Empiricist Approach to Philosophy and the Existence of God
#### A. Overview of Empiricism and Its Relevance to the Question of God's Existence

Empiricism is a philosophical approach that emphasizes experience as the primary source of knowledge. This perspective suggests that all knowledge comes from sensory experiences, observations, and empirical evidence. In the context of philosophy, empiricists often focus on the natural world and human experience, seeking explanations for phenomena through observation and experimentation.

However, when it comes to questions about the existence of God, empiricism might seem at odds with the idea of a divine creator. After all, direct experience of God is not typically considered a part of our everyday sensory experiences. Nevertheless, several philosophers who identify as empiricists have argued for the existence of God, including Aristotle and others.

#### B. The Cosmological Argument: A Family of Arguments Explaining the Cosmos through a Divine Creator

One such argument is the cosmological argument, which attempts to explain the cosmos and the universe through the concept of a divine creator. This family of arguments focuses on God's role as the creator of the world and argues for its existence based on the idea that something cannot come from nothing.

**Key Concept:** _Cosmological Argument_ - A philosophical argument attempting to demonstrate the existence of God by explaining the origin of the universe through a divine creator.

#### C. The Classical Conception of God

The classical conception of God, as classically philosophers have tended to think about it, is of a being who is:

* **Omnipotent** (all-powerful)
* **Omnipresent** (exists everywhere)
* **Omniscient** (all-knowing)
* **Eternal** (everlasting)
* **Infinite in power, knowledge, and so on**
* **Transcendent** (beyond the world itself)
* **Conscious**

However, there are alternative conceptions of God that deviate from this classical idea. These include:

* **Deism**: Viewing God as a creator who has had no further interaction with the world.
* **Pantheism**: Identifying God with nature itself.
* **Panentheism**: Seeing God as both transcendent and immanent, yet not identical with the universe.

#### D. The Cosmological Argument in Detail

The cosmological argument comes in various forms, but its simplest version states that if something exists, it must have been caused by something else. This chain of causation cannot go on infinitely, leading to absurdity.

**Key Concept:** _Causation_ - A relationship between events or entities where one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect).

One version of the argument, attributed to Aquinas, posits that there must be a first cause, which is God, because an infinite series of causes would lead to absurdity. Another version, from Avicenna, argues that everything contingent cannot enter into being except for some reason, and this chain of reasons cannot go on infinitely without leading to absurdity.

#### E. Debates Surrounding the Cosmological Argument

Philosophers have debated the concept of an infinite chain of causes, with some arguing that it is impossible due to the nature of causation. Others have countered that mathematical models demonstrate no conceptual impossibility in an infinite succession of things extending into the past.

**Key Concept:** _Infinite Succession_ - A sequence of events or entities where there is no beginning or end.

One philosopher's response was to suggest that the necessary being could be a backward infinite series of contingencies, effectively making the universe self-sustaining. This idea has been interpreted as allowing for pantheism, where God is identified with nature itself.

Another philosopher proposed two senses of causation: one involving events preceding each other in time, and another involving an inseparable dependence between cause and effect. He argued that while an infinite series of efficient causes may not be problematic, an infinite descending chain of grounding dependence relations would be impossible, as it would mean that nothing is truly grounded.

**Key Concept:** _Grounding Dependence_ - A relationship where one entity or event depends on another for its existence or properties.

This idea has been likened to the mythological concept of "turtles all the way down," where each level of support is itself supported by another, ad infinitum.
