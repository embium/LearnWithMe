### I. Empiricist Reasoning on Religion and God's Existence
#### A. Overview of Empirical Arguments

Empiricist reasoning about religion and the existence of God often involves arguments based on experience, which are characteristic of empiricism. These empirical arguments differ from cosmological ones, such as those based on creation and the ultimate grounds of the universe. While cosmological arguments reason about the nature of a first cause or creator, empirical arguments focus on the natural world's character, design, and purpose.

#### B. Empirical Arguments in the Natural World

Empiricist tradition emphasizes experience and observation, leading to arguments that apply principles from within the natural world to understand its own nature and purpose. One such argument is presented by Paul in Acts 17, where he addresses philosophers in Athens, arguing that the natural world has an explanation for its existence, which cannot be found within itself but must come from outside.

**Key Principles:**

*   Something's natural if it's part of the natural world.
*   Something supernatural if it's not.
*   Everything includes itself.

#### C. Applying General Scientific Principles

Paul applies general scientific principles to the natural world as a whole, concluding that its explanation must lie outside the natural world in something supernatural. He uses Aristotle's four causes - efficient, formal, material, and final - to develop different versions of this argument, each highlighting a different aspect of God's nature.

#### D. Problems with Empiricist Arguments

The empiricist tradition's emphasis on experience and observation leads to arguments that focus on the natural world as a whole, but also raises problems, such as:

*   How to reconcile the various aspects of God's nature into a single being.
*   Whether it makes sense to attribute purposes to things lacking awareness.

#### E. Purpose and Design in the Universe

The concept of purpose and design in the universe has been a subject of debate, with some arguing that everything is directed by a single entity, while others propose that individual conscious beings assign purposes. The idea that natural law itself gives things purposes or goals points to someone aware and intelligent, suggesting a creator behind the structure of physical law.

#### F. Modern Versions of Empiricist Arguments

A more modern version of the argument, founded on the example of a watch, suggests that the universe is like a watch, with intricate complexity and success in doing something, implying an intelligent maker. The criteria for distinguishing naturally occurring things from products of design include having parts and an organized structure, being contrived and designed, and having a purpose that can be understood.

#### G. Fine-Tuning and Designer

A key aspect of the argument is the concept of fine-tuning, where even tiny changes in physical constants would render the universe inhospitable to life, suggesting a designer who has carefully crafted the universe for a specific purpose.
