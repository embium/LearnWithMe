### I. Aristotle's Concept of Happiness as the Ultimate End
#### A. Introduction to Utilitarianism

Aristotle's idea that happiness is the ultimate end of all human action has been explored in various philosophical theories, including utilitarianism. This concept suggests that what really matters is creating happiness and minimizing unhappiness. The more happiness there is in the world, the better it is, while the less happiness, the worse it is.

#### B. Key Figures: Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill

Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill are key figures associated with utilitarianism. They advocated for maximizing overall happiness and minimizing unhappiness. According to Bentham's principle of utility, every action should be evaluated based on its tendency to promote or oppose happiness.

*   **Bentham's Principle of Utility:** "The greatest happiness of the greatest number" emphasizes the importance of considering the happiness of everyone who might be affected by an action.
*   **Mill's Contribution:** Mill built upon Bentham's ideas, arguing that individual liberty and autonomy are essential for maximizing overall happiness.

#### C. Criticisms and Objections to Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism has faced criticisms and objections, including:

*   **Quantifying Happiness:** The challenge of measuring and comparing the happiness of different individuals.
*   **Complex Decision-Making:** Difficulty in making decisions when multiple outcomes are possible and competing interests arise.

#### D. Consequentialism: A Universalist Approach to Morality

Consequentialism holds that the only thing that ultimately matters is the consequence of an action. This perspective emphasizes the importance of considering the impact on individuals and society as a whole, rather than focusing solely on character virtues or intentions.

*   **Universalism:** Everyone's happiness is considered equally valuable.
*   **The Ends Justify the Means:** The goal of producing as much happiness as possible can justify any means necessary to achieve it.

#### E. Challenges and Implications of Consequentialism

Consequentialism raises questions about the morality of actions like assassinating a leader or sacrificing an innocent person for the greater good. In such cases, the consequences of the action must be weighed against the potential harm caused, and the moral compass must consider the impact on all individuals affected by the decision.

*   **Balancing Pleasure and Pain:** Consequentialism seeks to maximize overall happiness by considering the balance of pleasure over pain for the entire group.
*   **Individual Interests vs. Collective Good:** The theory emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the collective good over individual interests or desires.
