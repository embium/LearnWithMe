### I. The Foundations of Empiricism: Tosta and the Role of Experience
#### A. Understanding Knowledge through Experience

Empiricism, as a philosophy, posits that knowledge comes from experience. This concept is easily applied to everyday life, where we learn about objects and events through our senses. For instance, recognizing a table in a room involves sight and touch, while learning about brewing basil in one's front yard involves smell and taste. However, some aspects of human understanding, such as morality and ethics, are not so straightforwardly derived from experience.

#### B. The Challenge of Ethics

Ethics presents a challenge to empiricism because it deals with abstract concepts like what is good or bad, right or wrong, just or unjust, virtuous or vicious. These concepts cannot be directly observed through our senses, making them difficult to account for on an empiricist model.

### II. Confucius and the Social Basis of Ethics
#### A. The Unique Approach of Confucius

Confucius offers a unique perspective on ethics that is based on social roles and relationships rather than reason or emotion. He argues that we cannot judge someone's actions without knowing their social relations, and that our obligations to others vary depending on the type of relationship we have with them.

#### B. The Three-Part Theory of Ethics

Confucius' theory of ethics has three main parts:

*   **Theory of Character**: What kind of person I should be
*   **Theory of Action**: What I should do
*   **Theory of Decision**: How I should decide what to do

He believes that these questions are independent of each other, and that an ethical theory must address all three.

#### C. Key Concepts in Confucian Ethics

Confucius introduces the concepts of:

*   _Ren_ (altruism or benevolence)
*   _Yi_ (righteousness or justice)
*   _Li_ (propriety or etiquette)

These concepts are central to his philosophy, but he does not provide a clear account of human nature. Instead, he focuses on what can be observed in human behavior and relationships.

### III. The Concept of Virtue
#### A. Innate Knowledge vs. Learned Behavior

The concept of virtue is complex, with various philosophers offering different perspectives on what it entails. Mencius would argue that our knowledge of right and wrong is innate, and that we have an immediate reaction to certain situations, such as the recognition of people in need being helped without expectation of reward.

#### B. The View of Virtue as a Learned Behavior

Another philosopher's view is that human nature is inherently selfish, and that ethics is about controlling individual desires for the greater good. According to this perspective, virtues such as generosity, sincerity, diligence, and kindness are not innate, but rather require training and education to develop.

#### C. The Delicate Balance of Virtue

This philosopher argues that virtue is a mean between extremes, with failing to be virtuous occurring when one goes too far in either direction. For example:

*   Being too generous can lead to neglecting one's own needs
*   Being too serious can make one somber all the time
*   Sincerity can be taken too far, leading to recklessness
*   Diligence can become excessive, making one dull

This view suggests that virtues are not innate, but rather require effort and practice to develop, and that there is a delicate balance between extremes that must be maintained in order to exhibit virtuous behavior.
