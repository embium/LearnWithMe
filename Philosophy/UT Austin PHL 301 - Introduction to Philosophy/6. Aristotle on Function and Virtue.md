### I. Understanding Human Purpose
#### A. The Debate on Human Purpose

The concept of human purpose has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Some argue that humans have no inherent purpose, while others propose that it is up to individuals to decide their own purpose. This debate highlights the complexity and subjectivity of understanding what makes us special and distinct from other things.

#### B. Aristotle's Approach to Human Purpose

Aristotle suggests examining the distinguishing characteristics of various entities, such as knives, eyes, and teachers, to determine their functions. He proposes that humans have a unique capacity for rational thought, which enables them to construct cultures, use language, and engage in complex behaviors. This perspective raises questions about whether humans can be good or bad at fulfilling their function and what it means to excel at this activity.

#### C. The Core Function of Human Beings

Aristotle identifies the ability to act according to rational plans as the core function of human beings. This encompasses not only physical actions but also mental activities such as thinking, planning, and problem-solving. He argues that humans have a unique capacity for rational thought, which is connected to their distinguishing characteristics.

#### D. The Interplay between Rational Thought and Human Purpose

Understanding human purpose requires examining the complex interplay between rational thought, mental activities, and physical actions. This perspective also touches on the idea of human beings being part of a larger system, with their purpose defined by their role within that system.

### II. Excellence in Human Beings
#### A. Defining Excellence

The concept of excellence can be understood in two distinct ways: as rationality, which involves having a well-planned approach to life, and as an activity, where one excels in a particular endeavor. However, this raises questions about how to identify goodness when people use their exceptional abilities for evil purposes.

#### B. Excellence in Confucian Thought

In Confucian thought, living within the mean is considered excellent. This involves carrying out a plan with virtue and moral character. The development of rational excellence requires practice and habituation, whereas intellectual virtues can be taught to some degree. Moral virtues, on the other hand, are developed through habits and cannot be simply learned or communicated by others.

#### C. Virtues in Aristotle's Philosophy

Aristotle's concept of virtues emphasizes the importance of finding a mean between extremes, where desires are constrained but not suppressed entirely. He identifies various virtues, including courage, self-control, generosity, and friendliness, which involve choosing the right actions in the right circumstances for the right reasons.

#### D. The Role of Practical Wisdom

Practical wisdom is essential for navigating complex situations and making decisions that balance competing values and interests. This state of character concerned with choice lies in a mean relative to us, determined by a rational principle. It guides the man of practical wisdom in making decisions about how to live a good life.

### III. Developing Virtues
#### A. The Process of Habituation

To attain a particular virtue, one must find a role model, imitate them, and eventually develop the habit of exhibiting that virtue. This process requires practice and sensitivity, as well as the ability to distinguish between virtuous and vicious behavior.

#### B. The Importance of Role Models

Finding a role model is crucial in developing virtues. Imitating their behavior and eventually developing the habit of exhibiting that virtue can lead to the development of moral character.

#### C. The Limitations of Intellectual Virtues

Intellectual virtues can be taught to some degree, but they are not sufficient for achieving excellence. Moral virtues, on the other hand, require practice and habituation to develop.

### IV. Conclusion
The concept of human purpose is complex and multifaceted. Understanding what makes us special and distinct from other things requires examining the interplay between rational thought, mental activities, and physical actions. Excellence in human beings involves developing virtues through practice and habituation, as well as finding a mean between extremes. Ultimately, achieving excellence requires a deep understanding of oneself and one's place within the larger system of human society.
