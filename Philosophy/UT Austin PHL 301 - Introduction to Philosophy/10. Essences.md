### I. The Concept of Essence in Classical Indian and Greek Philosophy
#### A. Introduction to Substance and Identity

The concept of substance has been central to understanding identity and change in classical Indian philosophy and ancient Greek thought. Aristotle, a prominent figure in this discussion, agreed with his Indian counterparts that substance is the most fundamental category of being. However, he differed in his understanding of what constitutes a substance.

Aristotle's perspective on substance was influenced by his observations of everyday life. He noted that substances can undergo change while remaining the same thing. For example, a person sleeping and waking up or a candle melting from solid to liquid are instances where the substance remains intact despite changes in its state. To account for this phenomenon, Aristotle introduced the concept of essence.

#### B. Essence: The Properties Essential to an Individual's Identity

Aristotle defined essence as the properties that are essential to an individual's identity. These essential properties cannot be lost without changing the nature of the substance itself. In contrast, accidental properties can change without affecting the substance's fundamental identity. This distinction is crucial in understanding what constitutes an essential property versus an accidental one.

**Essence**: The inherent qualities or characteristics that define an individual's identity and cannot be changed without altering their fundamental nature.

Examples:

* A person's DNA or genetic structure
* Certain personality traits and memories

#### C. Distinguishing Essential from Accidental Properties

Philosophers have debated the issue of what constitutes an essential property versus an accidental one. Some argue that it is the internal perspective of self-awareness that defines an individual's essence, while others claim that external factors such as brain function and body composition play a crucial role.

**Accidental Properties**: Characteristics or traits that can change without affecting an individual's fundamental identity.

Examples:

* A person's occupation
* Relationships
* Physical transformations (e.g., surgery)

#### D. The Complexity of Identity and Essence

The concept of identity and essence has long been debated, with various philosophers offering differing perspectives. Aristotle's ideas on the matter are particularly relevant, as he characterized essence in several ways:

* What it is to be that thing
* What it is by virtue of itself
* What it is by its very nature
* What is expressed in a definition of a thing

Aristotle famously defined a human being as a rational animal, which implies that rationality and animality are essential properties of humanity. However, this raises questions about how one defines an individual, particularly when considering the complexities of personal identity.

#### E. The Relationship Between Nature and Nurture

The complexity of this issue is further highlighted by the fact that our understanding of the relationship between nature and nurture has become increasingly nuanced, making it difficult to distinguish between genetic and environmental influences on identity.

**Nature vs. Nurture**: The debate surrounding whether an individual's characteristics or traits are primarily determined by their genetics (nature) or environmental factors (nurture).

#### F. Aristotle's Ideas on Matter and Form

Aristotle's ideas on matter and form also come into play in this discussion, with some arguing that a person's essence is tied to their physical body, while others propose that it resides in their spiritual or metaphysical aspects.

**Matter**: The physical substance or material that constitutes an individual's body.
**Form**: The essential qualities or characteristics that define an individual's identity and are not necessarily tied to their physical body.

#### G. Quiddity and the Complexity of Essence
The concept of quiddity, as discussed by Aquinas, further complicates the issue, suggesting that there are two senses of essence: what makes something what it is (quiddity) and what causes it to be that way (nature). This distinction highlights the complexity of defining an individual's essence and raises questions about how we understand personal identity.

**Quiddity**: The essential qualities or characteristics that define an individual's identity and make them what they are.
