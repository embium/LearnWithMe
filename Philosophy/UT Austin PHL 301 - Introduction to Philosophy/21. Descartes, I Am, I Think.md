### I. Introduction to Early Modern Philosophy
#### A. The New Method: Descartes' Approach to Knowledge

Descartes initiated early modern philosophy with a new way of thinking about ideas, which he referred to as his "new method." This approach involved taking a first-person perspective and questioning everything that can be doubted. By systematically examining the nature of knowledge and certainty, Descartes aimed to find a foundation for knowledge that cannot be questioned.

#### B. The Method of Doubt

In his work, Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes begins by doubting all his beliefs, including those about his own existence. He uses skeptical arguments, such as the possibility of dreaming or being deceived by an evil genius, to challenge his own perceptions and understanding of the world. This method of doubt allows him to question everything that can be doubted, ultimately leading him to a conclusion about his own existence.

#### C. The Foundation for Knowledge

Descartes' method of doubt leads him to conclude that he exists as a thinking being, which is the only thing he can be certain of. He posits that every time he thinks, "I think," it must be true, and conversely, when he doubts, the fact that he is doubting proves his own existence as a thinking being. This notion is distinct from mere existence, as it implies a level of consciousness and self-awareness.

### II. The Concept of "I" and "Thinking"
#### A. The Significance of "I Think"

The concept of "I think" is central to philosophical inquiry, particularly in the works of Descartes. He argues that this notion is distinct from mere existence, as it implies a level of consciousness and self-awareness. Every time he thinks, "I think," it must be true, and conversely, when he doubts, the fact that he is doubting proves his own existence as a thinking being.

#### B. The Distinction between "I Am" and "I Think"

Descartes distinguishes between "I am" and "I think," with the former representing a more fundamental aspect of his nature, inferred from the latter. This distinction reflects a broader philosophical approach, where some thinkers prioritize first-person experiences and self-perception over external observations.

### III. The First-Person Perspective
#### A. Prioritizing Self-Perception

Descartes is notable for being one of the first to adopt a strictly first-person perspective, using skeptical arguments against himself to arrive at the conclusion that he knows his own existence and thinking are undeniable facts. This approach prioritizes self-perception over external observations.

#### B. Comparison with Other Philosophical Perspectives

In contrast to Descartes' focus on the first-person perspective, other philosophers have emphasized the importance of human relationships and the second-person perspective. For example, a German philosopher has highlighted the significance of starting with the "I-Thou" relationship between individuals. This approach reflects a broader philosophical debate about the relative importance of different perspectives in understanding knowledge and reality.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. The Legacy of Descartes' New Method

Descartes' new method, which involves taking a first-person perspective and questioning everything that can be doubted, has had a profound impact on early modern philosophy. His approach to knowledge, as outlined in Meditations on First Philosophy, continues to influence philosophical inquiry today.

#### B. The Significance of the Concept of "I Think"

The concept of "I think" remains central to philosophical debates about the nature of knowledge and reality. Descartes' conclusion that he exists as a thinking being, which is the only thing he can be certain of, continues to shape discussions about the foundations of knowledge and the importance of self-perception in understanding human existence.
