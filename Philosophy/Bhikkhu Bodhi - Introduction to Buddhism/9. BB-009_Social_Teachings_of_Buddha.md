### I. The Social Dimension of the Buddha's Teaching
#### A. Introduction to the Misconception of Buddhism as an Otherworldly Religion

The social dimension of the Buddha's teaching is often misunderstood and misrepresented as an exclusively otherworldly religion, solely concerned with a transcendental goal without any relevance to this world. This distorted view neglects the fact that the ultimate aim of the Buddhist teaching is the transcending of the world, but not in isolation from human life.

#### B. The Two Dimensions of the Dharma

The Buddha teaches that every aspect of human life is connected to other aspects, and that life in the world can become part of the path leading to deliverance. The Dharma has two dimensions: a dimension of depth, which leads to the overcoming of the world, and a dimension of breath, which embraces all facets of human existence and shows how they can be transformed into the comprehensive path leading to liberation.

#### C. The Buddha's Life as an Example

The Buddha's life illustrates this balance, as he renounced his household life to seek enlightenment but later returned to the world to teach and proclaim his doctrine to all people. His teachings show that the Dharma is relevant to people from all walks of life, and that it can lead to three types of benefits: benefit in this present life, benefit in future lives, and ultimate benefit or liberation.

#### D. The Three Aspects of the Buddha's Teaching

To give a fully adequate account of the Buddha's teaching, these three aspects must be included together, as emphasizing one to the exclusion of others leads to a distorted representation. The first benefit promotes economic, political, and social justice, personal well-being, happiness, and peace of mind; the second benefit shows us how to cultivate our karma for favorable rebirths; and the third benefit is the achievement of ultimate welfare and happiness through the attainment of Nirvana.

### II. The Social Application of the Buddhist Doctrine
#### A. The Concern for One's Own Good and the Benefit of Others

The social application of the Buddhist Doctrine is rooted in two basic concerns: the concern for one's own good and the concern for the good of others. The Buddha teaches that there are two types of benefit to take into account: our own benefit and the benefit of others, and that we should always reflect before acting on any action to ensure it does not harm ourselves or others.

#### B. Balancing Self-Concern with Altruistic Motives

The Buddha emphasizes the importance of balancing self-concern with altruistic motives, as seen in his statement about the four types of people found in the world. This balance is essential for achieving true happiness and well-being.

### III. The Concept of Dharma
#### A. The Cosmic Law that Supports All Phenomena

The concept of Dharma is central to Buddhist social thought, signifying the cosmic law that supports all phenomena and upholds moral truth. It divides into many Damas, or ideals of conduct, according to different spheres of human activity.

#### B. Principles of Social Ethics

The doctrine of egolessness (anata) implies certain principles of social ethics, as it teaches that the idea of self is the root of suffering and that we must uproot the sense of selfhood by beginning to act in ways that contribute to diminishing its grip. This can be achieved through wisdom arising from meditation, which is cultivated through pure and selfless actions of body and speech.

### IV. The Four Sublime States
#### A. Foundations for the Social Ethic of Buddhism

The four sublime states (Brahma viharas) - loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity - are also foundations for the social ethic of Buddhism, as they are to be developed in meditation and can reach expression in concrete action in the social, economic, and political spheres.

### V. Economic Concerns
#### A. The Importance of a Secure Economic Foundation

The Buddha recognized that there are many interdependent spheres of human activity that cannot be reduced to a simplistic view. He taught that if people are to be capable of personal and spiritual progress, the economic foundation must be secure, and that poverty can become a cause of social chaos and deterioration.

#### B. The Responsibility of the Government

The government has the responsibility to correct any kind of extreme economic injustice, as seen in the story of the king who failed to provide for his people's welfare, leading to social disorder and crime. Rulers must provide for their needs: feed for cattle, grain for crops, capital for businesses, and jobs for civil servants.

### VI. The Buddha's Teachings on Economic Matters
#### A. Generosity, Virtue, and the Importance of Giving Food

The Buddha's teachings on economic matters are practical and specific, emphasizing generosity, virtue, and the importance of giving food, which is said to bring long life, beauty, good complexion, happiness, strength, and intelligence.

### VII. The Role of the Government in Promoting Virtue
#### A. Providing for the Material Welfare of Citizens

The government should provide for the material welfare of its citizens and promote their moral and spiritual development, avoiding four evil motives: partiality, anger, delusion, and fear.

#### B. Observing Royal Virtues

The ruler should also observe 10 Royal virtues, including generosity, self-sacrifice, justice, gentleness, austerity, freedom from enmity, nonviolence, patience, and non-opposition to the will of the people.

### VIII. The Conquest of Adversity
#### A. Avoiding War and Violence

The Buddha also taught that war should be avoided, as it leads to violence, resentment, and anxiety, and that true conquest is the conquest of oneself, not others.

#### B. Cultivating Virtues for True Triumph

His followers are advised to make four kinds of conquest: over evil passions, over anger, over delusion, and over the five hindrances to meditation. The path to victory over adversity lies in cultivating virtues such as goodness, truth, generosity, and love.
