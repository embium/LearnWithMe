### I. Understanding Meditation in Buddhist Practice
#### A. The Purpose of Meditation

Meditation plays a crucial role in Buddhist practice as a means to achieve spiritual development. However, its purpose can only be grasped by understanding the teaching itself and balancing knowledge with practice. This balance is essential, as having knowledge without practice is futile, just like counting someone else's property without owning anything oneself. Similarly, practicing without understanding is like reading menus in a restaurant without eating anything.

To reach a goal, one must know where they're starting from, where they're going, and what route to take. This requires understanding the teaching of the Buddha, known as the Dhamma. The Dhamma signifies the true nature of phenomena, the real mode of existence, and the path that leads to its realization. It is not created by the Buddha but discovered through his enlightenment.

#### B. The Three Stages of Wisdom

The teaching aims at the growth of wisdom, which is the key to realization. This growth occurs in three stages:

*   **Wisdom born of learning**: Understanding the Dhamma through knowledge and study.
*   **Wisdom born of reflection**: Reflecting on what has been learned and contemplating its meaning.
*   **Wisdom born of meditation**: Applying oneself to realize the inner meaning of the Dhamma through meditation.

#### C. The Importance of Meditation

Meditation is essential in Buddhist practice as it allows individuals to directly experience the truth of the Dhamma. It enables them to develop wisdom, which is the key to realization. Through meditation, one can cultivate a deeper understanding of the world and themselves, leading to spiritual growth and development.

### II. The Story of the Buddha
#### A. The Birth of the Buddha

The story of the Buddha begins with his birth in the Shakya clan around 563 BC. However, from traditional Buddhist perspectives, the story goes back much further, into the past, where every Buddha arrived and achieved high attainment through a career spanning many lives during this period, known as a bodhisattva.

#### B. The Life of the Bodhisattva

The bodhisattva worked to protect himself from certain virtues that come to maturity with his attainment of Buddhahood. According to Pali sources, the body soccer career of our own Buddha began countless kalpas ago in the dispensation of a Buddha named Deepankara, who is the 26th Buddha before Gautama.

#### C. The Aspiration and Prediction

The young man made an aspiration to become a Buddha himself someday. The Buddha then gave him a prediction that so many hundreds and thousands of eons in the future, this person would become a Buddha named Gautama. From that time on, this being became a bodhisattva in the proper sense of the term and dedicated himself to developing sublime virtues that would fructify with his Buddhahood.

#### D. The Perfection of Paramis

For countless lives, the Bodhisattva toiled and strove to perfect these qualities, sometimes dedicating several lives to developing one parameter, while other times dedicating several lives to perfecting another. The paramis include generosity, moral discipline, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness, and equanimity.

### III. The Enlightenment of the Buddha
#### A. The Renunciation of Wealth and Status

The Bodhisattva then went on to master various systems of philosophy and meditation from famous teachers in ancient India, but found them deficient because they focused exclusively on concentration rather than wisdom. He abandoned these teachers and their systems, throwing himself into deeper self-mortification, which he carried to an extreme.

#### B. The Final Resolution

The Bodhisattva then abandoned this course and resumed taking food, regaining strength and vigor. He went on to sit beneath a tree called the Bodhi tree, where he made a firm resolution to remain until he had achieved enlightenment.

#### C. The Internal Struggle and Enlightenment

A tremendous internal struggle waged within his mind as Mara, the personification of all desire and attachment, tried to tempt him with honor, power, and fame, but the Bodhisattva remained unmoved. He then touched the ground, calling the earth to witness his fulfillment of all apparent ease, and the earth shook, crumbled, and sent out its applause, saying yes, he had fulfilled all the paramis.

#### D. The Realizations of Wisdom

With his mind concentrated, the realizations of wisdom began to unfold over the three watches of the night. In the first watch, he recollected all his former lives, seeing himself through the innumerable kalpas going through the stages of birth, growth, aging, and death. He saw everything changing, transient, mutable, and dreamlike.

In the second watch, he developed the divine eye, with which he could see the rise and passing away of all sentient beings, understanding the universal laws at work beneath the surface manifestations of systems. In the third watch, he penetrated the deepest truths of the Dhamma, discovering the law of dependent arising, developing the patna insight into the real characteristic of all things, and arriving at the realization of the Four Noble Truths.

### IV. The Teachings of the Buddha
#### A. Emphasis on Individual Understanding

The Buddha's teachings emphasize individual understanding and effort, rejecting blind faith and belief. He encourages his followers to examine and scrutinize his doctrine, just as a goldsmith tests metal to determine its authenticity, until they become convinced of its truth.

#### B. Universality and Openness

This approach is reflected in the Dhamma's rapid spread, which can be attributed to its universality and openness to all who are willing to listen. The Buddha taught people from all social classes, occupations, and backgrounds, without restrictions or esotericism, revealing the beauty of his doctrine when it is shared openly.

#### C. Skillful Means

The Buddha's skillful means also played a significant role in the Dhamma's widespread acceptance, as he could tailor his teachings to meet the needs and capacities of each individual listener.

### V. The Final Passing Away
#### A. The Last Discourse and Exhortation

As he approached the end of his life, he set out on his final journey, accompanied by his disciples, to the town of Kusinara, where he delivered a last discourse and exhorted his followers to work out their own salvation with diligence.

#### B. Parinirvana and Cremation

With these words, he entered into successive stages of meditation and attained parinirvana, the final passing away. His body was then carried to the eastern gate of Kusinara, where it was cremated with honors due to a universal monarch.
