### I. The Truth of Suffering: A Starting Point for Understanding the Dharma
#### A. Introduction to the First Noble Truth

The Buddha's teaching begins with the truth of suffering, which serves as a starting point for understanding the entire Dharma. This fundamental concept is essential in grasping the nature of reality and the path to liberation. The truth of suffering is not the final word in the Buddha's teaching; it is merely the first step towards freedom from suffering.

#### B. The Nature of Suffering

We live in a world of delusion, where we see things as pleasurable, attractive, and permanent, and take our personalities to be a self. This leads us to seek pleasure and gratify our ego, causing us to get lost in the world of finite concerns and become swept away by time. The Buddha alerts us to the danger and makes us see the problems and peril that we face. He announces that our lives are burning with old age, sickness, and death, and that our minds are flaming with the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion.

#### C. The Principal Cause of Suffering: Craving (Tanha)

According to the Buddha, the principal cause of suffering is craving (tanha), which is the desire for personal gratification, existence, and a world of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touch sensations, and ideas. To eliminate this cause of suffering, the key is to eliminate craving, and the third Noble Truth explains that this can be achieved by eliminating craving through the extinction of tanha.

### II. The Cessation of Suffering: A Reality Beyond Conditioned Phenomena
#### A. The Psychological Dimension

At the psychological level, we find that unhappiness, contentment, or suffering results from the tension between desire and the lack of the thing desired. This conflict can be overcome in one of two ways: by obtaining the object of desire or by eliminating the desire itself.

#### B. The Philosophical Dimension

The Buddha reverses the common assumption that happiness can be found by satisfying our desires, pointing out that true happiness is achieved by taking the opposite approach â€“ eliminating the desire. When we eliminate craving, our mind remains satisfied, content, and happy no matter what our external situation might be.

### III. Nirvana: The Supreme Dharma
#### A. Definition of Nirvana

The state of final deliverance is called Nirvana (Nirvana), which means the extinguishing of the flame of craving, the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. The Buddha says that just as the waters of a river plunge into the ocean and merge with it, so the spiritual path plunges into Nirvana and merges with it.

#### B. Characteristics of Nirvana

Nirvana is described as the unconditioned reality that is beyond all finite properties. It is also referred to as the Supreme Dharma, the cessation of suffering, the unafflicted, the sorrowless state, the fearless state, and the deathless state. By using these terms, the Buddha awakens in us the aspiration to attain Nirvana.

#### C. Attainment of Nirvana

The attainment of Nirvana is not something that can be brought into existence by following the path; rather, it is a reality that already exists and can be discovered through direct experience. The path leads to Nirvana, but Nirvana itself is timeless and unconditioned. The Buddha describes Nirvana as a state beyond all conditioned phenomena, utterly distinct from them.

### IV. Stages of Attainment: Nibbana Element with Residue Remaining and Without Residue Remaining
#### A. Nibbana Element with Residue Remaining

The first stage is attained by the arahant (the liberated one) in this present life, while the second stage is attained at the end of their lifespan. In the first stage, the arahant's mind is free from all defilements, but the five aggregates still stand as a residue. This state is marked by complete happiness, peace, inner freedom, and full awakening in understanding.

#### B. Nibbana Element Without Residue Remaining

The second stage is attained at the end of the arahant's lifespan. In this stage, the process of becoming comes to an end, and there is no more rebirth. The question often arises about the state of the arahant after death, whether it is a state of annihilation or eternal existence.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. Understanding Nirvana

The attainment of Nirvana is not something that can be fully comprehended by finite concepts or devices. It is described as being deep, immeasurable, and unfathomable, much like the great ocean. The Buddha rejects both alternatives of annihilation and eternal existence, saying that any attempt to answer this question is inapplicable and invalid.

#### B. Final Thoughts

The Buddha's teaching begins with the truth of suffering, which serves as a starting point for understanding the entire Dharma. Through the elimination of craving and the attainment of Nirvana, we can find true happiness and freedom from suffering. The path to liberation is not something that can be fully understood by the mind; it must be experienced directly through practice and realization.
