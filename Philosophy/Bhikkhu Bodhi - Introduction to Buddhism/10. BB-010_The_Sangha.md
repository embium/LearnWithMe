### I. The Three Jewels: The Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha
#### A. Introduction to the Three Jewels

The Buddhist dispensation is founded upon three guiding ideals: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. These three are together called the Three Jewels or Triple Gem, which are considered the most precious things in the world for one seeking Liberation.

#### B. The Arya Sangha
- **Definition**: The Arya Sangha consists of noble persons who have reached the super-mundane paths and fruits, including stream-enterers, once-returners, non-returners, and Arhats.
- **Characteristics**: These individuals are united by their penetration through direct experience of the innermost essence of the Dharma, having followed the Buddha's path to wisdom and seen the ultimate truth.
- **Importance**: The Arya Sangha is essential to the Buddhist dispensation, as they stand as living proof of the truth of the Buddha's teaching, having put the teaching to the test and verified it in their own experience.

#### C. The Conventional Sangha
- **Definition**: The conventional Sangha refers to the monastic order.
- **Characteristics**: The monastic order provides ideal conditions for reaching the Arhat state, attaining Enlightenment, and realizing Nibbana.
- **Importance**: Renunciation is a key aspect of becoming a monk, as it involves cutting off attachment to worldly life and dedicating oneself fully to spiritual development.

### II. The Sangha: A Community within the Buddhist Society
#### A. Types of Communities within the Sangha

The Sangha refers to two types of communities: the Arya Sangha and the conventional Sangha (the monastic order).

#### B. Benefits of Being Part of the Sangha

- **Serving as a Field of Merit**: The Sangha serves as a field of Merit for others, particularly lay people who make gifts to support them.
- **Inspiring Others**: The Sangha shows that the Dharma is not just a set of abstract theories but a real path that can be practiced.

### III. Monastic Life and the Sangha
#### A. Levels of Monastic Status

There are two basic levels of monastic status: the rank of the novice (somaera) and the rank of the fully ordained monk (biku).

#### C. The Ceremony of Upaa

- **Requirements**: To be eligible for upaa, one must have been a somaera for some time, usually several years, and meet certain conditions.
- **Procedure**: The ceremony requires a Sangha of at least five bikus, who are headed by a senior biku with good knowledge of Dharma and Vinaya.

#### D. The Patimokkha

The Patimokkha is the code of 227 rules that regulate monastic life.

### IV. The Role of the Sangha in Buddhist Society
#### A. Study, Teach, and Expound the Scriptures

### V. The Place of Nuns in Buddhism
#### A. Historical Context

In India at the time Buddhism arose, women were held in a position of gross subservience to men; they received very little consideration as individuals in their own right.

#### B. The Order of Fully Ordained Nuns

- **Establishment**: The Buddha established an order of fully ordained nuns.
- **Regulations**: The Buddha laid down several special regulations for the nun, which should be appreciated against the social background of the time.
