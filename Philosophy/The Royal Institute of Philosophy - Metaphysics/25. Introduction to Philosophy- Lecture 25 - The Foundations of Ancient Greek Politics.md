### I. Ancient Greek Conception of Politics
#### A. Overview of Aristotle's Philosophy

Aristotle's philosophy posits that society and government arise from nature rather than agreement or contracts between individuals. This naturalistic conception of society differs from the modern view, which predicates politics on a contractual understanding of society. At its core, Aristotle's thought emphasizes the importance of moral and civic virtue in human flourishing.

#### B. The Role of Virtue in Human Flourishing

Two essential elements from Aristotle's ethics underlie this pre-modern political philosophy: first, moral and civic virtue comprise the good for human beings taken as a species; second, these virtues can only be acquired and exercised in a social context. This means that humans are not solely self-interested individuals but rather social creatures who require a community to develop and exercise their virtues.

#### C. The Concept of Humans as a "Political Animal"

Aristotle's idea that humans are by nature a political animal is central to his thought, with the polis (city-state) providing the essential framework for human flourishing. This conception of politics sees the state existing to facilitate the development of moral and civic virtue.

#### D. The Hierarchy of Social Affiliation

Aristotle's Politics distinguishes between various levels of social affiliation and institutionalization, pairing them with human functions and needs that they fulfill:

*   **Household**: The most fundamental social relationships are those between men and women (procreation) and ruler and ruled (preservation), which arise from natural needs and serve as the foundation for all social life.
*   **Village**: The next level of social organization, where institutions and forms of life go beyond mere survival and preservation, allowing for the cultivation and exercise of moral and civic virtue.
*   **City-State**: The highest level of social organization, providing the frameworks necessary for human flourishing as described in Aristotle's ethics.

#### E. Human Flourishing in the City-State

A city-state serves the ultimate need of living well and flourishing as human beings. This is achieved through civic virtues that support institutions of learning, arts, and culture, providing frameworks in which people can flourish. The life of contemplation and pursuit of knowledge are essential human goods, requiring a sufficient level of social and political organization, along with wealth, to be possible.

### II. Comparison with Modern Views
#### A. Introduction to John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism

In contrast to ancient Greek thought on politics, modern views will be explored later in the course, starting with John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism. Students should compare and contrast Mill's conception of happiness with Aristotle's concept of human flourishing.

#### B. Comparison of Human Nature

This comparison will reveal similarities and differences between the modern and ancient worlds, providing insight into our development as a civilization. The picture of human nature emerging from utilitarianism will be compared with the pre-modern conception, highlighting key points of agreement and disagreement.

### III. Conclusion
Aristotle's philosophy provides a rich understanding of the ancient Greek conception of politics, emphasizing the importance of moral and civic virtue in human flourishing. This naturalistic conception of society differs from modern views, which predicate politics on a contractual understanding of society. The comparison with modern views will provide insight into our development as a civilization and highlight key points of agreement and disagreement between pre-modern and modern conceptions of politics.
