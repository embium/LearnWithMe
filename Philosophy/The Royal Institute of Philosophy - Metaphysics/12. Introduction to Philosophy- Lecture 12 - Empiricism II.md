### I. The Empiricist Philosophy
#### A. Overview of John Locke's View

The empiricist philosophy, as exemplified by John Locke, posits that all substantive knowledge comes from experience. This experience can be either sensory, through our sense organs, or contemplative, through reflection on our own thoughts. Empiricists believe that both forms of experience are experiential and that knowledge derives from them.

#### B. The Role of Experience in Knowledge Acquisition

Locke's view is that the mind begins as a blank slate, or "white paper," upon which information is printed by its interaction with the world through the senses and reflection on its own thoughts. This notion is central to empiricist philosophy. Locke's empiricism has been influenced by the Scientific Revolution, which sought a scientific picture of human nature, and the Enlightenment philosophers' firm belief in individual intellectual autonomy.

*   **Key Concept:** The idea that knowledge comes from experience, rather than innate ideas or divine revelation.
*   **Example:** A person learns about the world through their senses (e.g., seeing a red apple) and reflection on their own thoughts (e.g., thinking about the taste of the apple).

#### C. Ideas of Sensation and Reflection

Locke believes that our first ideas are ideas of sensation, acquired through perceptual experience, and only once we have these can we then have ideas of reflection. He thinks it's impossible to contemplate or reflect upon one's thought contents prior to having any thought contents. Our minds start out blank and small, and as information comes in from the world and is generated by reflection, the mind and its capacity to think literally expand and grow.

*   **Key Concept:** The distinction between ideas of sensation (derived from experience) and ideas of reflection (derived from thinking about one's own thoughts).
*   **Example:** A person learns about a new concept through direct experience (e.g., learning to ride a bike) and then reflects on that experience to understand the underlying principles.

#### D. Primary and Secondary Qualities

Locke also divides the characteristics of our ideas into two classes: primary qualities, which are aspects of our mental pictures that have counterparts in the external world, such as solidity, extension, figure, and mobility; and secondary qualities, which are purely effects of our sensory interaction with the external world, having no corresponding characteristics in the external world. Our worlds will differ very much with respect to its secondary qualities, but there will be a certain commonality to all our worlds, based on primary qualities.

*   **Key Concept:** The distinction between primary qualities (existing independently in the external world) and secondary qualities (phenomenal effects of sensory interaction).
*   **Example:** A person perceives a red apple as having both primary qualities (solidity, extension, figure) and secondary qualities (color).

### II. Critiques and Challenges to Locke's View
#### A. Skepticism and the Nature of Reality

Locke's view has given rise to more problems than it solves, and philosophers have been engaged for centuries in trying to solve these problems. His empiricism has spawned new branches of thought, including 20th-century empiricism, which addressed some of the original problems but also gave rise to new ones that are still being untangled today.

*   **Key Concept:** The challenge of skepticism, which questions how we know what the external world is really like and whether we can ever truly know its nature.
*   **Example:** A person may doubt their perception of reality due to the limitations of their senses or the influence of external factors.

#### B. Berkeley's Empiricist Critique

Locke's argument for the immutability of primary qualities is challenged by the possibility that our perception of them could be mistaken or misleading, leading to doubts about the existence of an external world. This skepticism is further exacerbated by Berkeley's empiricist critique, which argues that all knowledge comes from experience and therefore there is no basis for believing in an external world beyond the curtain of ideas.

*   **Key Concept:** The challenge of Berkeley's empiricism, which questions the existence of an external world independent of our perceptions.
*   **Example:** A person may question whether their perception of reality is a direct reflection of the external world or simply a product of their own mind.
