### I. The Philosophy of Common Sense: A Scottish Naturalist Perspective
#### A. Overview of Human Nature in Scottish Naturalism

The philosophy of common sense, also known as Scottish naturalism, diverges from classic Enlightenment epistemology by viewing human nature as a complex interplay between thinking and doing. Unlike traditional philosophy, which emphasizes the rational aspects of humanity, Scottish naturalists see humans as both thinkers and actors, with our capacity for action being essential to our humanity. This perspective is rooted in the idea that human beings are not just rational creatures but also social agents, with our actions speaking to our identities in a way that animal behavior does not.

#### B. The Importance of Prudence and Practicality

The Scottish naturalist view of human nature is crucial to understanding their philosophy, which emphasizes prudence as much as truth. They argue that excessive rationalism, or the pursuit of knowledge without consideration for action and practicality, can lead to mental illness and paralysis. Hume and Reid contend that the person who excessively prioritizes reason over action will inevitably find themselves in a state of depression and unable to engage with the world.

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Scottish naturalism views human nature as a balance between thinking and doing.
    *   Excessive rationalism can lead to mental illness and paralysis.
    *   Prudence and practicality are essential aspects of human existence.

#### C. Rejection of Pure Skepticism

The Scottish naturalists also reject pure skepticism, which they see as an unlivable philosophy. They argue that it is impossible for humans to truly withhold assent from basic beliefs such as the existence of the external world or other minds. These common-sense beliefs are necessary in two senses: we can't help but believe them, and we can't know anything else without believing in these things first.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Pure skepticism is an unlivable philosophy.
    *   Humans cannot truly withhold assent from basic beliefs.
    *   Common-sense beliefs are necessary for human knowledge and understanding.

#### D. The Concept of Common Sense

The Scottish naturalists' emphasis on prudence and practicality is reflected in their concept of common sense, which refers to a basic stock of beliefs that are unjustifiable but essential. These beliefs include the existence of the external world, other minds, and the notion that the future will generally be like the past. They argue that these beliefs are natural and arise from our human constitution, rather than being acquired through sensory experience or deductive reasoning.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Common sense refers to a basic stock of beliefs.
    *   These beliefs are unjustifiable but essential for human knowledge and understanding.
    *   They arise from our human constitution, not sensory experience or deductive reasoning.

#### E. Nuanced Understanding of Human Nature

The Scottish naturalists' philosophy is characterized by a nuanced understanding of human nature, which recognizes both the importance of reason and the need for action and practicality. Their emphasis on prudence and common sense provides a balanced view of human existence, one that values sound judgment and behavior in the long term over mere pursuit of truth or knowledge.

*   **Key Insights:**
    *   Human nature is complex and multifaceted.
    *   Reason and action are both essential aspects of human existence.
    *   Prudence and common sense provide a balanced view of human existence.
