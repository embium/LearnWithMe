### I. The Evolution of Scientific Thought and Its Impact on Society
#### A. Introduction to the Concept of Modernity and Control Over Nature

The last 500 years have witnessed successive scientific revolutions that have profoundly transformed our understanding of the world, leading to an exponential increase in technological advancements. This has resulted in a desire for control over nature and one's own life, which is a fundamental aspect of modernity. The Enlightenment and its ideals of individual freedom and autonomy represent a revolt against external control, but this has also led to a desire for greater control over human behavior and the environment.

#### B. The Emergence of Scientifically Planned Societies

Some intellectuals have advocated for a scientifically planned and managed society, where science and technology are used to eliminate social and natural ills. This idea is exemplified by thinkers like HG Wells and B.F. Skinner, who believed that a scientific understanding of human behavior could lead to a perfect society. However, this vision raises concerns about the control of individuals and the potential for a technocratic society where scientists manage people's lives.

#### C. The Role of Science in Shaping Human Behavior

Skinner argued that traditional notions of personhood, freedom, and dignity are myths that hinder our progress towards a scientifically managed society. He believed that these concepts are based on an outdated self-image that prevents us from developing a science and technology of behavior as advanced as those in physics, biology, and chemistry.

### II. B.F. Skinner's Views on Personhood and Mentalism
#### A. Introduction to Skinner's Thought

B.F. Skinner was a renowned psychologist who spent half a century at Harvard University advocating for psychological behaviorism and social engineering. Despite his controversial views, he was motivated by humanitarian concerns to change the way society addresses its problems.

#### B. Skinner's Critique of Personhood and Mentalism

Skinner argued that personhood and mentalism are outdated concepts that hinder our progress towards a scientifically managed society. He believed that these notions are based on an incorrect self-image that prevents us from developing a science and technology of behavior as advanced as those in physics, biology, and chemistry.

#### C. Skinner's Scientific Objections to Personhood and Mentalism

Skinner's critique of personhood and mentalism is intellectually separable from his social and political ambitions. His scientific objections to these concepts are crucial to his desire for a technology of behavior in a scientifically planned society. We will explore the details of Skinner's reasons for rejecting personhood and mentalism, as well as his desire for a technology of behavior in a scientifically planned society.

### III. The Implications of Skinner's Views
#### A. The Tension Between Individual Freedom and Control

Skinner's views highlight the tension between individual freedom and control, and the potential for science to be used to manage human behavior. His ideas raise concerns about the control of individuals and the potential for a technocratic society where scientists manage people's lives.

#### B. The Potential for a Technocratic Society

Skinner's vision of a scientifically managed society raises questions about the role of science in shaping human behavior and the potential for a technocratic society where scientists manage people's lives.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Points

In conclusion, Skinner's views on personhood and mentalism highlight the tension between individual freedom and control, and the potential for science to be used to manage human behavior. His ideas raise concerns about the control of individuals and the potential for a technocratic society where scientists manage people's lives.

#### B. Future Discussion

We will delve into the details of Skinner's reasons for rejecting personhood and mentalism, as well as his desire for a technology of behavior in a scientifically planned society. This discussion will be based on Skinner's works "Science and Human Behavior" and "Beyond Freedom and Dignity".
