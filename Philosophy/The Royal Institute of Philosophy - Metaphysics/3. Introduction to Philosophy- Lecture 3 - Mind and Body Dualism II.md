### I. Descartes' Theory of Mind-Body Dualism
#### A. Overview of the Theory

Descartes' theory of mind-body dualism posits that the body is a physical substance, like a machine, and the mind is a non-physical thinking substance that inhabits the body. This view is based on his conceptions of science, which he outlines in two basic lines of argument.

#### B. Distinguishing Between Matter and Mind

Descartes' first line of argument involves distinguishing between the properties of matter and those of mind. He argues that just as a machine can replicate the physical functions of an animal or human being, but not use language in the same way, so too must there be a non-physical basis for thought. This leads him to infer that since human beings have one ability - using language - that animals and machines lack, it follows that this capacity is not bodily, but rather a function of a non-physical mind.

**Key Concept:** _Mind-body dualism_ refers to the idea that the mind and body are separate entities. Descartes' theory posits that the mind is a non-physical thinking substance that inhabits the body.

#### C. Comparing Human Beings with Animals and Machines

Descartes compares human beings with animals and machines, arguing that just as a machine can replicate the physical functions of an animal or human being, but not use language in the same way, so too must there be a non-physical basis for thought. This comparison leads him to draw a distinction between the principles causing our motions, with one being purely mechanical and corporeal, and the other an incorporeal mind or soul.

**Weaknesses of Descartes' Argument:**

* Assuming animals do not think
* Ignoring the possibility that thought may be a matter of degree
* Relying on language as an external indicator of genuine thought, which can be simulated by machines

#### D. The Problem of Other Minds

Descartes' argument for mind-body dualism raises the problem of other minds, where we question how we know whether someone else is thinking or has a mind.

**Key Concept:** _The problem of other minds_ refers to the challenge of determining whether another person's mental states are genuine or not. This problem arises from Descartes' argument that our own mental existence is more certain than the belief in one's bodily existence.

#### E. The Cogito Argument

Descartes begins his argument with the observation that our senses can be unreliable, leading us to doubt any belief based on sensory experience. He notes that even if we're dreaming, our experiences can be indistinguishable from those while awake, making it impossible to know for certain whether we're dreaming or not.

**Key Concept:** _The cogito argument_ refers to Descartes' conclusion that the only thing he cannot doubt is his own thinking, as doubting requires thought itself. This leads him to conclude that the proposition "I am, I exist" is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by him.

#### F. Limitations of Descartes' Argument

Despite its limitations, Descartes' argument has been influential in shaping modern secular thought. However, it faces significant challenges when applied to scientific contexts, particularly in understanding mental-physical causality and the unobservable nature of the mind.

**Key Concept:** _Mental-physical causality_ refers to the relationship between mental states and physical events. Descartes' dualistic view renders any scientific approach to psychology impossible, leading to difficulties in inferring minds and thoughts from external behavior.

#### G. Conclusion

Descartes' theory of mind-body dualism has been influential in shaping modern secular thought, but it faces significant challenges when applied to scientific contexts. Understanding the limitations and weaknesses of his argument is essential for developing a more comprehensive view of the relationship between mind and body.
