### I. Introduction to John Locke's Political Philosophy
#### A. Background and Context

John Locke's ideas have had a profound impact on modern liberal political philosophy. His foundational text, the Second Treatise on Government, not only justified the Glorious Revolution but also shaped Western democracies. To understand why we should participate in civil society and accept government authority, Locke asks if it serves a rationally self-interested person's interests.

#### B. The State of Nature Thought Experiment

Locke hypothesizes what life would be like without social and political institutions, creating the state of nature thought experiment. In this hypothetical scenario, humans are perfectly free and equal, with no social or political constraints. However, this freedom is not absolute; individuals have natural rights and laws that govern their behavior.

**Key Term:** _State of Nature_ - a hypothetical scenario where humans live without social and political institutions, highlighting the need for government and law to maintain order and protect individual rights.

#### C. Natural Rights and Laws

Locke deduces that we have a natural right not to be harmed and a natural law not to harm others. He assumes that our equality and freedom are intended by God, making it an obligation to maintain these conditions. In the state of nature, each individual is sovereign over their own life and has jurisdiction to enforce the natural law in their own case.

**Key Term:** _Natural Rights_ - inherent rights that individuals possess simply because they exist as human beings, including the right not to be harmed and the right to defend oneself.

#### D. Private Property and Economic Growth

Locke's account of private property is essential to his political philosophy and modern liberal democracies. Individuals have a right to live, the means to live, and the primary goods necessary for survival. Private property rights are limited by the principle of proportionality, ensuring that no one takes more than they can use without wasting resources.

**Key Term:** _Private Property_ - the right to own and control goods and resources, essential for economic growth and individual prosperity.

### II. The Social Contract
#### A. The Need for Government

Life in the state of nature fails the rationally selfish person test due to its inefficiency. Individuals must spend a significant amount of time protecting their property and enforcing the natural law, which severely limits their ability to accumulate wealth and pursue happiness. This realization leads to the idea of the social contract, where individuals agree to transfer authority to a third party, such as a government, to enforce the law of nature and maintain order.

**Key Term:** _Social Contract_ - an agreement among individuals to establish a government that enforces laws and maintains order, in exchange for protection and security.

#### B. Characteristics of Good Government

To sustain this arrangement, it's essential that everyone is held equally accountable by the law, has equal opportunities to pursue their happiness, and is constrained equally by the law. Democracy and constitutionalism are key characteristics of good government under the social contract model, ensuring that power is distributed fairly and that individual rights are protected.

**Key Term:** _Democracy_ - a system of government where power is held by the people or their elected representatives, ensuring equal participation and protection of individual rights.

#### C. The Right to Revolt

John Locke argues that absolute government cannot be justified given these assumptions, as it would lead to a situation worse than life in the state of nature. The right to revolt or overthrow a government also arises when it no longer serves the interests of its citizens, highlighting the importance of individualism and self-interest in modern political thought.

**Key Term:** _Right to Revolt_ - the ability of individuals to challenge or overthrow a government that fails to protect their rights and interests.
