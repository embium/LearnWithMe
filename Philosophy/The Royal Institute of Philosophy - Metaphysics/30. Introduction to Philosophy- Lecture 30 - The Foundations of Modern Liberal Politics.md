### I. The Foundations of Modern Liberal Politics
#### A. Overview of Enlightenment Thought

Modern liberal politics is rooted in the Enlightenment, a philosophical movement that emphasized individual rights and prerogatives. This philosophy rejected the idea of a common human good prevalent in pre-modern ancient Greek thought, instead focusing on the importance of individual happiness and freedom.

#### B. The Three Foundational Ideas of Modern Liberal Politics
The core principles behind modern liberal political philosophy are **individualism**, **egalitarianism**, and **contractualism**.

- **Individualism**: This concept posits that there may be as many goods as there are individuals, making it difficult for government to promote a single conception of the good. In essence, individualism suggests that each person has their own unique values, interests, and goals.
  
- **Egalitarianism**: Egalitarianism rejects natural hierarchies, assuming human beings are equal and not ranked in any sort of natural order. This idea emphasizes the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances.

- **Contractualism**: Contractualism assumes that civil society and political life arise from individual agreements, rather than being inherent to human nature. This view is reflected in social contract theory, which posits that individuals enter into a social contract with others to form a government that protects their rights and freedoms.

#### C. The Logic of Contracts: The "Rashly Selfish Person Test"

The logic of contracts is central to modern liberal political philosophy. A key principle guiding this philosophy is the **"rashly selfish person test,"** which asks whether a rational self-interested person would choose to enter into a particular agreement or remain in a state of anarchy.

- This test serves as a guide for evaluating whether a contract or social arrangement is justified.
  
- It emphasizes the importance of individual consent and voluntary participation in shaping society and government.

#### D. John Locke's Second Treatise of Government
John Locke's **Second Treatise of Government** is a foundational text of modern political philosophy, offering a justification for consensual government and the right of revolution in the face of tyrannical rule.

- The treatise begins with an account of the state of nature, asking whether life in this condition passes the rational self-interested person test.
  
- Locke's work points towards a social contract and a specific kind of civil society and political life that prioritizes individual rights and freedoms.
