### I. Aristotle's Conception of Human Virtue and the Good Life
#### A. The Human Soul: A Complex Entity Comprising Subcomponents with Distinct Functions

Aristotle presents a complex picture of the human soul, comprising subcomponents with distinct functions. At its core are two types of souls: the non-rational soul and the rational soul. The non-rational soul is responsible for involuntary physical movement, while the rational soul governs mental activity, including practical deliberation and theoretical speculation.

#### B. The Rational Soul: Practical Reason and Theoretical Reason

Within the rational soul, there are two distinct parts:

*   **Practical Reason**: Concerned with action, reasoning about ends and means, and identifying the right thing to do. This capacity enables humans to deliberate over their actions, identify right and wrong, and make appropriate choices.
*   **Theoretical Reason**: Engaged in higher-order contemplative thinking, seeking truth and producing knowledge. Excellence in theoretical reasoning leads to justified true beliefs, a distinctly human form of excellence that only humans possess.

#### C. Moral Virtue: A Combination of Identifying the Right Thing to Do and Following Through on It

Aristotle defines moral virtue as a combination of identifying the right thing to do and following through on it. This concept is fundamental to understanding human excellence and the good life. The successful application of practical reason to volition consists of choosing to do what practical reason recommends, which Aristotle calls moral virtue.

#### D. Forms of Reason: Theoretical, Philosophic, and Scientific

Aristotle discusses three forms of reason:

*   **Theoretical Reason**: Seeking truth and producing knowledge.
*   **Philosophic Reason**: A name given to the second part of the rational soul, concerned with higher-order contemplative thinking.
*   **Scientific Reason**: Also a name for the second part of the rational soul, focused on theoretical reasoning.

#### E. The Contemplative Life: A Pursuit of Truth and Wisdom

Aristotle's concept of the contemplative life involves a pursuit of truth and wisdom that is distinct from the moral life, which involves virtue and civic activity. This capacity for knowledge is what Aristotle calls the contemplative life, a distinctly human form of excellence that only humans possess.

#### F. Conclusion

In conclusion, Aristotle's conception of human virtue and the good life centers on rational thought and behavior. The successful application of practical reason to volition consists of choosing to do what practical reason recommends, which Aristotle calls moral virtue. This concept is fundamental to understanding human excellence and the good life.
