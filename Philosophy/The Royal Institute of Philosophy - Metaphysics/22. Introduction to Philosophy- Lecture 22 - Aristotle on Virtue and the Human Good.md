### I. Introduction to Aristotle's Ethics
#### A. Overview of Virtue Ethics

Aristotle's ethics is a classic example of virtue ethics, focusing on the central question of what constitutes human fulfillment or excellence. In his work, Aristotle gives more than one answer to this question, drawing upon various elements such as an analysis of human nature, moral and civic virtue, contemplation, and relationships with God.

#### B. Key Concepts in Virtue Ethics

*   **Virtue**: In the context of ethics, virtues refer to character traits that enable individuals to live a good life. Aristotle identifies virtues as habits or dispositions that allow people to perform their functions well.
*   **Eudaimonia**: Eudaimonia is the Greek term for human flourishing or happiness. Aristotle defines eudaimonia as the ultimate goal of human existence, which can be achieved through living a life of virtue and fulfilling one's distinctive human function.

### II. Understanding Human Nature
#### A. Teleology: The Purpose of Things

Aristotle's philosophy is rooted in a broader understanding of the universe as imbued with purpose. This teleological view holds that every process and activity, both natural and artificial, has a function or purpose. Understanding this purpose is essential to grasping the nature of things and their behavior.

#### B. Identifying Human Function

Aristotle's ethics aims to identify the human good, which he defines as eudaimonia, or human flourishing. He argues that it consists of living a life of virtue and fulfilling one's distinctive human function. To understand what constitutes human fulfillment, Aristotle suggests examining the essential characteristics and functions of a human being.

#### C. Comparing Human Function to Other Classes of Things

Aristotle proposes identifying the characteristic activity or function of a human being by comparing it with other classes of things, noting those characteristics that differentiate humans from others. This method allows him to infer that humans have a distinctive function or purpose, which he aims to identify through further analysis.

### III. Defining Human Characteristics
#### A. Shared Characteristics Among Living Beings

The most basic characteristic of life is not sufficient to define humanity, as it is also present in plants and simple organisms. Sentience, or the capacity for sensory experience and sensation, is also a common trait among animals, making it an insufficient defining characteristic for human beings.

#### B. The Capacity for Rational Thought and Behavior

Aristotle argues that the capacity to think and act under the guidance of reason is what uniquely defines humans. This capacity for rational thought and behavior is the purpose that attaches to what is distinctive about human beings, and it is the life of rational behavior and thought that constitutes the human good.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. The Significance of Aristotle's Ethics

Aristotle's ethics offers a rich and nuanced understanding of human nature and the human good. His emphasis on virtue, eudaimonia, and the capacity for rational thought and behavior provides a compelling framework for exploring what constitutes human fulfillment and excellence.

#### B. Implications for Modern Thought

The ideas presented in Aristotle's ethics continue to influence contemporary debates in philosophy, politics, and education. Understanding his concepts and arguments can provide valuable insights into the nature of human existence and the importance of cultivating virtues and living a life of purpose.
