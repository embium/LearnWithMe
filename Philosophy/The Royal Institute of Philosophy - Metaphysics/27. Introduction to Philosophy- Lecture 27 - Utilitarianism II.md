### I. Introduction to Utilitarianism
#### A. Overview of John Stuart Mill's Theory

John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism is a moral philosophy that holds actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness and wrong as they tend to produce unhappiness. According to Mill, the ultimate aim of our action should be to promote the general happiness in a population, rather than focusing on individual happiness or distribution of happiness.

#### B. Key Principles

- **Hedonic Calculus**: Mill's utilitarianism implies that rightness and wrongness are matters of degree, with some actions being more morally objectionable than others.
- **Aggregate vs. Distributive Reading**: The theory can be interpreted in two ways: as an aggregate reading, where the focus is on the overall amount of happiness in a population, or as a distributive reading, where the distribution of happiness among individuals is prioritized.

### II. Challenges and Criticisms
#### A. Impracticality and Long-Term Consequences

Mill's utilitarianism faces significant challenges due to its impractical nature. Calculating long-term consequences can be difficult, making it challenging to determine which actions will ultimately lead to the greatest happiness.

#### B. Distributive Justice and Retribution

The theory often yields morally counterintuitive results in cases involving distributive justice, such as the lifeboat example or the case of a doctor who murders his wife but holds the secret to curing cancer. In these situations, the theory prioritizes actions that produce the greatest amount of happiness over those that promote fairness or punish wrongdoing.

#### C. Moral Luck and Intentions

- **Moral Luck**: The utilitarian view faces significant challenges due to the problem of moral luck, where the moral value of an action is largely determined by factors outside one's control.
- **Intentions vs. Outcomes**: The theory disregards intentions altogether, which many find morally problematic. For instance, saving a person from drowning might be considered a good deed regardless of one's motivations.

### III. Comparison with Kantian Philosophy
#### A. Prioritizing Principles and Reason

Kant's moral philosophy prioritizes principles and reason over outcomes, which can help address some of the concerns raised by utilitarianism. Despite their differences, the two philosophies share a common problem: each theory seems to thrive where the other one withers.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Complementary Theories

Mill's utilitarianism and Kantian philosophy may be complementary rather than mutually exclusive. While they differ in approach, both theories face significant challenges that can inform and improve our understanding of moral principles.
