### I. Introduction to Utilitarianism
#### A. Overview of Utilitarian Theory

Utilitarianism is the dominant moral theory in the Western world today. It holds that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. This theory was not created by John Stuart Mill, but he is its most sophisticated and influential spokesman.

#### B. Key Principles of Utilitarianism

- **Happiness as the sole intrinsic good**: Mill's version of utilitarianism argues that there is only one intrinsic good, which is happiness.
- **Pleasure and absence of pain**: He defines happiness as pleasure and the absence of pain, aligning himself with the Epicurean tradition.

#### C. Limitations and Criticisms of Utilitarianism

The chief complaint against utilitarianism is that it presents humans in an undignified light, making them seem no better than animals. Critics argue that this view portrays humans as being motivated solely by animalistic pleasures, implying a negative picture of human nature.

#### D. Mill's Response to Criticisms

Mill anticipates and responds to these objections by arguing that his theory does not necessarily reduce humans to the level of animals, but rather recognizes that pleasure and pain are fundamental aspects of human experience. He connects himself to the Epicurean tradition, arguing that it is not hedonists who present human nature in a degrading light, but rather those who accuse them of doing so.

#### E. Higher Forms of Pleasure

Mill maintains that human beings are capable of experiencing higher forms of pleasure, which involve both sensation and intelligence, and that these distinctively human pleasures comprise human happiness. He illustrates this distinction by pairing animalistic pleasures with their human counterparts, such as lust versus love, and the pleasure of satiation versus gastronomic enjoyment.

#### F. The Role of Culture in Shaping Human Values

Mill emphasizes the importance of cultural environment in shaping our values and aspirations, warning that neglecting this aspect can lead to a life of beastial base worthless pleasures. He concludes by highlighting the need for equal concern with both physical and cultural environments, as the former is not sufficient without the latter.

#### G. Conclusion

In conclusion, Mill's version of utilitarianism presents a nuanced view of human nature, recognizing that pleasure and pain are fundamental aspects of human experience. While critics may argue that this view reduces humans to the level of animals, Mill responds by highlighting the importance of cultural environment in shaping our values and aspirations.
