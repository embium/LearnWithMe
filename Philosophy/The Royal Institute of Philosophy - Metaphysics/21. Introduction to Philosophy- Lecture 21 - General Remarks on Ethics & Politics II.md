### I. Introduction to Political Philosophy
#### A. Historical Context of Civil Society and Government

Political philosophy explores fundamental questions about how individuals should live in society. Historically, this question has been divided into two parts: why there should be a civil society and government, and what form that society and government should take. The first question is distinctively modern, arising only in the context of modern political philosophy, while the second question arises both in modern and premodern contexts.

The concept of civil society refers to voluntary social and civic institutions among people, predicated on agreement and compromise. It's contrasted with the state, which is ultimately backed by force. Understanding this distinction is crucial for grasping the evolution of political thought over time.

#### B. Premodern vs. Modern Political Thought

Premodern political thought conceives social relations and authority in natural terms, whereas modern thought views them almost entirely in contractual terms. The premodern mind assumes the existence of civil society and government, focusing on what form they should take. In contrast, modern philosophy begins with the question of why there should be a civil society and government, only later addressing what form that society and government should take.

This shift from natural to contractual thinking has significant implications for how we understand authority, power, and individual identity. Premodern societies viewed individual identity as deeply intertwined with social, civic, and political relationships, whereas the modern mind conceives of individuals as self-sufficient entities capable of existing independently of these external relationships.

#### C. The Concept of Authority

Authority refers to the right to rule, which can be acquired through natural fitness or endowment (e.g., parents over children) or contractual agreement (e.g., an employer over an employee). This concept is distinct from power, which is the ability to exert influence or control over others.

In premodern societies, authority was often seen as a natural extension of social hierarchy and tradition. In contrast, modern thought emphasizes the importance of consent and contract in establishing legitimate authority.

#### D. The Emergence of Liberal Democracy

The modern answer to the question of why individuals should compromise and submit to authority is liberal democracy. This system requires the least amount of personal prerogative rights to be given up for the most benefit. The conception of human nature and individual identity that underlies liberal democracy has significant implications for political philosophy, including the justification of civil society and government.

### II. Key Concepts in Political Philosophy
#### A. Civil Society

*   **Definition:** Voluntary social and civic institutions among people, predicated on agreement and compromise.
*   **Contrast with the State:** Civil society is contrasted with the state, which is ultimately backed by force.

#### B. Authority vs. Power

*   **Authority:** The right to rule, acquired through natural fitness or endowment (e.g., parents over children) or contractual agreement (e.g., an employer over an employee).
*   **Power:** The ability to exert influence or control over others.

#### C. Premodern and Modern Political Thought

*   **Premodern Thought:** Conceived social relations and authority in natural terms.
*   **Modern Thought:** Views social relations and authority almost entirely in contractual terms.

### III. Implications for Political Philosophy
#### A. Justification of Civil Society and Government

The conception of human nature and individual identity that underlies liberal democracy has significant implications for political philosophy, including the justification of civil society and government. This shift from natural to contractual thinking requires a reevaluation of the role of authority and power in shaping social and political relationships.

#### B. The Importance of Consent and Contract

Modern thought emphasizes the importance of consent and contract in establishing legitimate authority. This has significant implications for how we understand individual identity, social hierarchy, and the role of government in society.

### IV. Conclusion
The evolution of political thought over time has led to a fundamental shift from natural to contractual thinking. Understanding this distinction is crucial for grasping the complexities of modern politics and the justification of civil society and government. The conception of human nature and individual identity that underlies liberal democracy has significant implications for political philosophy, including the role of authority and power in shaping social and political relationships.
