### I. Critique of Intellectualism: Gilbert Ryle's Argument
#### A. Overview of Intellectualist View

The intellectualist view posits that competence in performance is a result of possessing a body of true beliefs. This perspective suggests that one must first acquire knowledge and then apply it to perform tasks competently. However, philosopher Gilbert Ryle critiques this view, arguing that it is a myth. He contends that competence and performance are prior to the acquisition and deployment of propositional knowledge.

#### B. The Primacy of Competence
Ryle argues that knowing how precedes knowing that, meaning that one must be competent before acquiring a set of true beliefs. This idea is illustrated through examples from chess playing and bike riding, where mere possession of rules or instructions does not guarantee competence. In fact, one can be incompetent in these areas despite having knowledge of the relevant rules.

#### C. The Limitations of Propositional Knowledge
Ryle points out that the acquisition and deployment of propositional knowledge is itself a form of competent performance, which can be done competently or incompetently. This leads to an infinite regress if intellectualism is true, as each competence would require another body of propositional knowledge to explain it.

#### D. The Distinction Between Competence and Propositional Knowledge
Ryle emphasizes that competence is acquired through discipline and inculcation, which involves practice and repetition, rather than explicit instruction or habit formation. He argues that the acquisition of competencies, or performative knowledge, is distinct from propositional knowledge. While explicit instruction can impart truths, it cannot build up knowledge how, which involves knowing how to use that knowledge in practical situations.

#### E. The Importance of Performative Knowledge
Ryle highlights the importance of performative knowledge, which involves knowing how to do things. He argues that all knowledge involves knowing how to apply facts and principles in practical situations. This distinction between museum possession (knowing facts) and workshop possession (knowing how to apply those facts) underscores the need for hands-on learning experiences.

#### F. The Role of Apprenticeships and Tutorials
Ryle advocates for apprenticeship and tutorial models, where students learn by doing and receiving feedback from experienced tutors. He argues that this approach is more effective in acquiring competencies than traditional classroom instruction, which focuses on explicit information transfer.

#### G. Implications for Education
The implications of Ryle's argument are significant for education. He suggests that the traditional focus on propositional knowledge has led to a profound misunderstanding of what knowledge is and how it's acquired. By emphasizing the importance of performative knowledge and hands-on learning experiences, educators can create more effective learning environments that foster competence and performance.

#### H. Conclusion
In conclusion, Ryle's critique of intellectualism highlights the need for a shift in perspective on knowledge acquisition. He argues that competence and performance are prior to propositional knowledge and that the best way to acquire competencies is through apprenticeship and tutorial models. By understanding the importance of performative knowledge, educators can create more effective learning environments that prepare students for practical situations.
