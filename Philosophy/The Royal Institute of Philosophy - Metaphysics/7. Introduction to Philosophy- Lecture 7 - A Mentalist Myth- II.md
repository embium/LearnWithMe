### I. The Mind-Body Problem: A Linguistic Misunderstanding
#### A. Gilbert Riley's Critique of Mentalistic Accounts

Gilbert Riley's critique targets the mind-body dualism and mentalistic accounts of human nature and behavior, arguing that these views are based on a linguistic misunderstanding. This primary section will delve into Riley's argument and its implications for our understanding of the mind-body problem.

#### B. The Category Mistake: Misinterpreting Mentalistic Verbs

Riley argues that philosophical problems arise from misinterpreting words, particularly mentalistic verbs, which do not refer to mental objects or activities but rather describe behavioral dispositions. This category mistake leads to the assumption that there exist separate realms of thought and physical being, resulting in the mind-body problem.

*   **Key Concept:** _Mentalistic verbs_ are words like "hates" or "loves," which do not refer to mental actions but rather describe behavioral dispositions.
*   **Examples:**
    *   The university example: someone mistakenly allocates the concept of a university to the same category as physical entities.
    *   The military parade example: a child assumes that a division is a separate entity from the units marching by.

By recognizing this distinction, we can avoid positing the existence of a separate realm of mental objects and activities, thereby dissolving the mind-body problem.

#### C. Implications for Our Understanding of Human Nature

Riley's critique has significant implications for our understanding of human nature and behavior. By reexamining how we use mentalistic vocabulary, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of human behavior and avoid positing the existence of separate realms of thought and physical being.

### II. The Behaviorist School of Psychology
#### A. B.F. Skinner's Views on Mind, Freedom, and Values

The behaviorist school of psychology, founded by B.F. Skinner, remains a significant intellectual paradigm in psychological theory and clinical practice. This section will explore Skinner's views on mind, freedom, and values through two selections: one scientific treatise that outlines the logic of behaviorism, and another quasi-political treatise, "Beyond Freedom and Dignity," which describes the social and political consequences of behavioral psychology.

#### B. Key Questions to Consider

Three key questions to consider are:

*   What does Skinner believe is the ultimate aim of science?
*   Why does he think a science of man is necessary?
*   What does he find unscientific about the mentalistic concept of a person as comprising thoughts and other mental states?

Understanding Skinner's scientific views is crucial before addressing his social and political program, which will be discussed in future lectures.

#### C. The Logic of Behaviorism

Skinner's scientific treatise outlines the logic of behaviorism, which posits that human behavior can be understood through the study of environmental factors and behavioral dispositions. This approach has significant implications for our understanding of human nature and behavior.

### III. Conclusion
The mind-body problem is a complex issue that arises from misinterpreting words, particularly mentalistic verbs. By reexamining how we use mentalistic vocabulary, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of human behavior and avoid positing the existence of separate realms of thought and physical being. The behaviorist school of psychology, founded by B.F. Skinner, remains a significant intellectual paradigm in psychological theory and clinical practice. Understanding Skinner's scientific views is crucial before addressing his social and political program, which will be discussed in future lectures.
