### I. Introduction to the Limits of Reason and Philosophy of Common Sense
#### A. Overview of the Lectures and Exam Preparation

The lectures on the limits of reason and philosophy of common sense are currently underway, with two more sessions scheduled before the second exam. These lectures will explore the consequences of Descartes' project failure, which has significant implications for our understanding of human intellectual autonomy and competence.

#### B. Background: The Enlightenment Project and Descartes' Attempt

The Enlightenment thinkers had a strong notion of human intellectual autonomy and competence, positing that individual humans are capable of acquiring knowledge on their own. However, Descartes' attempt to vindicate this through rational justification came up empty, leading to widespread acknowledgment of his project's failure. Despite Descartes himself not thinking he had failed, subsequent thinkers realized that his project had serious problems.

#### C. Examining the Failure: Questions and Responses

The next two lectures will address the reasons for Descartes' failure and where to go from there. This will involve considering questions about our attitude towards the external world and objective truth, as well as human rationality and nature. Two main responses have been historically significant:

*   **Response 1: Alternative Versions of Descartes' Project**
    *   This response remains sympathetic to Descartes' motivations but seeks alternative versions of his project.
    *   It acknowledges the limitations of Descartes' approach while attempting to salvage its core ideas.

*   **Response 2: Accepting the Enlightenment Picture and Skepticism**
    *   This response accepts the Enlightenment picture but concludes that no beliefs are justified due to Descartes' failure.
    *   It takes a more skeptical stance, questioning the possibility of justification in the face of uncertainty.

### II. The Scottish Naturalist Approach
#### A. Overview: Philosophy of Common Sense

The Scottish naturalist approach, also known as the philosophy of common sense, has been influential in the past but was largely ignored in the 20th century. It is now experiencing a resurgence in interest. This perspective suggests that knowledge is possible only if some things are taken for granted without proof, and that justification itself presumes assuming things without reason.

#### B. Key Figures: David Hume and Thomas Reid

David Hume and Thomas Reid are key figures in this school of thought. They recognized the limitations of rationalism and the importance of common sense in shaping our understanding of the world.

#### C. The Ideal Theory: A Critique by Hume

The ideal theory posits that there are two objects of awareness: an immediate, mental representation, and a secondary, external object or process. However, this theory acknowledges that our ideas may not resemble the external world and that the first object may exist without the second. Hume critiques the ideal Theory for its inability to prove the existence of an external world, arguing that any attempt to do so would be subject to the same doubts that undermine our knowledge of the first object.

### III. Conclusion: Implications and Future Directions
#### A. The Legacy of Descartes' Failure

Descartes' project failure has significant implications for our understanding of human intellectual autonomy and competence. It highlights the limitations of rationalism and the importance of considering alternative perspectives, such as the philosophy of common sense.

#### B. Future Directions: Scottish Naturalism and Beyond

The lectures will continue to explore the consequences of Descartes' failure and where to go from there. The Scottish naturalist approach offers a promising direction for addressing these questions, but it is not without its own challenges and limitations.
