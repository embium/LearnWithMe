### I. The Problem of Knowledge: Squaring Thought Contents with Objective Truths
#### A. The Double Object View of Perception and Thought

Descartes' primary philosophical concern revolves around the problem of how we can reconcile our thought contents with the actual nature of things and objective truths that belong to the external world. This issue arises from a double object view of perception and thought, where the direct object of awareness is one's own mental pictures or ideas, and the connection with things in the external world constitutes a second object of cognition.

The prevailing view in the 17th and 18th centuries held that the immediate object of one's awareness is an idea. Consequently, our knowledge of the external world is only indirect, inferred from the characteristics of the mental object. This perspective raises questions about how we can determine that there even is an external world beyond our thoughts.

#### B. Descartes' Thought Experiment: The Ball of Wax

Descartes addresses this problem through a thought experiment involving a ball of wax in three different states: solid, liquid, and gas. At each stage, he makes a list of its observable characteristics, which change significantly over time. He then asks what is the true nature of the wax as it exists independently of our perception.

Descartes concludes that the wax's true nature is not a cluster of perceptible qualities but rather a set of primary qualities such as extension, flexibility, and mutability. This thought experiment illustrates Descartes' method, which involves a creative dynamic interplay of sensory perception and deductive reasoning.

#### C. The Assumption of an External World

Descartes' procedure assumes that the wax actually exists and that he is not dreaming or hallucinating the experiment. However, this assumption raises further questions about how we can be certain that our ideas correspond to anything at all.

### II. Correspondence with Reality: Proving God's Existence
#### A. Descartes' Solution: Proving God's Existence

Descartes attempts to address the problem of correspondence by proving God's existence, defining God as the sum of all perfection. He argues that a being with senses would be imperfect if there was no external world.

Descartes concludes that the external world must exist because God wouldn't have made us with eyes if there was nothing to see. However, this purported solution has been considered unsatisfying historically, and its rational basis is questionable.

#### B. Critique of Descartes' Solution

Descartes offers no proof or argument for believing that God is the sum of all perfections, and his definition of God's nature has no rational basis. The aim here is to show what the rational basis for human knowledge is, but Descartes' solution falls short in this regard.

#### C. Implications for Human Knowledge

Descartes' reliance on God as the rational basis for empirical knowledge creates problems, particularly since deductive reasoning, used to prove God's existence, has been called into question in Meditation One by the malicious demon argument. Furthermore, Descartes' solution relies on an assumption that God makes it possible for us to know, which is ironic given his Enlightenment views emphasizing human intellect autonomy and rationality.

### III. Alternative Strategies: The Philosophy of Common Sense
#### A. The Philosophy of Common Sense

Philosophers like David Hume and Thomas Reid proposed alternative strategies, including the philosophy of common sense, which emphasizes taking things for granted rather than strictly rational knowledge. This approach raises questions about the status of common sense beliefs, their justification, and whether human knowledge is limited by necessity or potentially infinite.

#### B. Implications for Human Knowledge

The philosophy of common sense challenges Descartes' solution and highlights the limitations of relying solely on reason to establish knowledge. It suggests that our understanding of the world may be more nuanced and context-dependent than initially thought, emphasizing the importance of practical experience and shared human experiences in shaping our knowledge.

#### C. Conclusion

Descartes' attempt to address the problem of correspondence between thought contents and objective truths raises important questions about the nature of human knowledge. While his solution has been influential, it also highlights the need for alternative approaches that take into account the complexities and nuances of human experience. The philosophy of common sense offers one such approach, emphasizing the importance of practical experience and shared human experiences in shaping our understanding of the world.
