### I. Critique of Mentalism: Rejecting Persons and Personal Identity
#### A. Overview of Mentalism and Its Critics

Mentalism is an umbrella position that encompasses various philosophical views, including dualism (e.g., Cartesian dualism) and non-dualistic perspectives (such as John Locke's). This approach posits that personal identity is comprised of conscious thoughts, beliefs, desires, and attitudes. However, critics argue that mentalism gives a false picture of human behavior and that there is no useful explanatory role to be played by persons or their mental states.

#### B. Key Features of Mentalism

Mentalism is characterized by two primary ideas:

1.  **Deliberate Behavior**: Critics argue that mentalists believe deliberate behavior is the direct result of conscious mental states.
2.  **Identity as Persons**: Mentalists hold that our identities as persons are comprised of these mental states.

#### C. Critique of Mentalism: Gilbert Ryle and B.F. Skinner

Critics, including Gilbert Ryle and B.F. Skinner, propose an alternative view called behaviorism. Behaviorists reject the idea of an interior self and believe that personal identity is not distinct from our biological humanity. They argue that all behavior is the result of environmental causes rather than mental ones.

#### D. Example: Mentalistic vs. Behavioristic Views

Consider a simple example: John drinks a glass of water. A mentalistic account would attribute this behavior to John's conscious state of being thirsty, while a behaviorist account would attribute it to environmental causes, such as working in the hot sun.

#### E. Ryle's Critique and Rejection of the Mind-Body Problem

Gilbert Ryle critiques mentalism and rejects the mind-body problem, which he attributes to linguistic confusions. He argues that philosophers systematically misinterpret and misunderstand the role played by mentalistic words in ordinary speech, leading to the illusion that these words indicate the existence of minds and thoughts as internal entities and processes.

#### F. Understanding Mentalistic Vocabulary

By understanding the correct way to understand our mentalistic vocabulary, we can see that the notion of a discrete self is simply the result of a confusion about language. This insight allows us to reevaluate the role played by persons and personal identity in philosophical discussions.

### II. Behaviorism: An Alternative View
#### A. Overview of Behaviorism

Behaviorism proposes an alternative view to mentalism, positing that all behavior is the result of environmental causes rather than mental ones. This approach rejects the idea of an interior self and believes that personal identity is not distinct from our biological humanity.

#### B. Key Features of Behaviorism

1.  **Environmental Causes**: Behaviorists argue that all behavior is the result of environmental causes.
2.  **Rejection of Mental States**: Behaviorists reject the idea of mental states, including thoughts, beliefs, desires, and attitudes.

#### C. Example: John Drinks a Glass of Water (Continued)

A behaviorist account would attribute John's action to environmental causes, such as working in the hot sun, rather than his conscious state of being thirsty.

### III. Implications and Future Directions
#### A. Reevaluating Persons and Personal Identity

The critique of mentalism and the rejection of the mind-body problem have significant implications for our understanding of persons and personal identity. By reexamining our mentalistic vocabulary and adopting a behavioristic perspective, we can gain new insights into human behavior and its causes.

#### B. Future Directions: Integrating Behaviorism with Other Perspectives

The lectures will explore how to integrate behaviorism with other philosophical perspectives, such as phenomenology and social constructivism, to develop a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and personal identity.
