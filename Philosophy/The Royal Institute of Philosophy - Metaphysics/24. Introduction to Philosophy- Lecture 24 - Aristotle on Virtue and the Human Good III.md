### I. Aristotle's Ethics: Emphasizing Moderation in Achieving Moral Virtue
#### A. Understanding Moral Virtue

Moral virtue arises from the intersection of practical reason and volition, making it a rational faculty that identifies the virtuous thing to do. This concept is central to Aristotle's ethics, as he emphasizes the importance of moderation in achieving moral virtue. In this context, moderation refers to finding a balance between opposing forces or extremes.

#### B. The Mean Between Extremes

Aristotle distinguishes between different senses of "rational," noting that one sense refers to prudence and moderation. He argues that moral virtues, such as temperance, courage, and honesty, represent moderate states of character and moderate choices of action, situated between extremes of excess and deficiency. For example:

*   **Courage** is the willingness to take risks in proportion to their importance, while cowardice represents an insufficient amount of this quality.
*   **Honesty** involves telling the truth when warranted, avoiding excessive truth-telling that can be a vice.

Aristotle's theory suggests that moral virtue always represents the mean between extremes, and what counts as moderate depends on the circumstances. This approach emphasizes the importance of practical wisdom and good judgment in determining the right course of action, rather than following rigid principles or rules.

#### C. The Role of Practical Wisdom

Aristotle argues that moral virtue is not the result of rule-following, but rather the inculcation of sound judgment and sensitivity to circumstances. He believes that ethics cannot be taught through explicit instruction, but rather through a process of apprenticeship and habituation, similar to how one acquires a skill or craft.

*   **Apprenticeship**: Moral virtue is developed through practice, observation, and correction, rather than through learning and memorization.
*   **Habituation**: Aristotle compares the development of moral virtue to the acquisition of a skill, such as becoming a good cabinet maker or roofer, which requires hands-on experience and guidance from a master craftsman.

#### D. Intellectual Virtues vs. Moral Virtues

Aristotle's views on ethics and human nature lead him to conclude that intellectual virtues, such as practical reason and philosophic reason, are developed through teaching and explicit instruction. In contrast, moral virtue is cultivated through experience and practice.

*   **Intellectual Virtues**: These include practical reason and philosophic reason, which are developed through teaching and explicit instruction.
*   **Moral Virtues**: These include virtues such as temperance, courage, and honesty, which are developed through a process of apprenticeship and habituation.
