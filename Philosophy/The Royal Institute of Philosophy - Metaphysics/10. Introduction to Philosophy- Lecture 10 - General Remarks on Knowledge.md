### I. Introduction to Epistemology
#### A. Overview of Epistemological Questions

Epistemology, the theory of knowledge, has been a subject of inquiry since ancient Greece. At its core, epistemology seeks to answer three fundamental questions: what is knowledge, how is it acquired, and what sort of certainty attaches to it. These questions have been debated by philosophers for centuries, with various perspectives on the nature of knowledge and how we can be certain about our beliefs.

#### B. The Traditional View of Knowledge

Traditionally, knowledge has been viewed as a subset of belief, specifically true belief. However, this raises concerns about whether one can ever know that they know something. To address these concerns, philosophers have added a justification condition to the definition of knowledge, requiring that one be justified in believing what they claim to know. This leads to the tripartite theory of knowledge: true belief plus justification.

#### C. Challenges to the Traditional View

The traditional view has been challenged by counterexamples, such as those proposed by Edmund Gettier. These examples suggest that even with truth and justification, knowledge may not be guaranteed. The implications of these challenges will be explored in more detail throughout this course.

### II. Orientations in Epistemology
#### A. Empiricism

Empiricism is one main orientation in the debate about how knowledge is acquired. Empiricists argue that all knowledge begins with sensory experience. This perspective emphasizes the importance of observation and experimentation in the pursuit of knowledge.

*   Key features of empiricism:
    *   Knowledge arises from sensory experience
    *   The senses provide the foundation for all knowledge
    *   Empirical evidence is essential for justifying beliefs

#### B. Rationalism

Rationalism is another main orientation in epistemology, suggesting that some knowledge comes from non-empirical methods, such as innate knowledge or a priori intuition. This perspective emphasizes the importance of reason and intellectual inquiry in the pursuit of knowledge.

*   Key features of rationalism:
    *   Knowledge can arise from reason and intellect
    *   Innate knowledge or a priori intuition provide a foundation for certain beliefs
    *   Reason is essential for justifying beliefs

### III. Skepticism and Certainty
#### A. The Nature of Skepticism

Skepticism has been explored in various forms, one of which questions the nature of reality by speculating about deception. A popular example from recent culture is the idea that our world might be a simulation created to deceive us, raising doubts about our perception of reality.

*   Key features of skepticism:
    *   Doubts about the reliability of our senses and reasoning abilities
    *   Possibility of dreaming or deception
    *   Uncertainty about things we think we know

#### B. Strategies for Overcoming Skepticism

Some philosophers have proposed strategies for overcoming skeptical challenges, such as foundational beliefs or axioms that require no proof and are self-evident. However, the general consensus in philosophical literature is that these strategies have not succeeded in overcoming skeptical challenges.

*   Key features of skeptical responses:
    *   Foundational beliefs or axioms that require no proof
    *   Self-evident truths that provide a foundation for certain beliefs
    *   Limitations on our capacity to know

### IV. Conclusions and Future Directions
#### A. The Limits of Human Knowledge

Many philosophers have concluded that human knowledge is inherently limited, with certain limits on our capacity to know. This perspective has been championed by thinkers such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant.

*   Key features of the limitations of human knowledge:
    *   Inherent limitations on our capacity to know
    *   Certain limits on what we can be certain about
    *   The importance of acknowledging these limitations in philosophical inquiry

#### B. Future Directions in Epistemology

The next lectures will explore the questions of how knowledge is acquired and what kind of certainty we can have, reading philosophers like John Locke, Rene Descartes, and others.

*   Key features of future directions in epistemology:
    *   The importance of understanding how knowledge is acquired
    *   The need to consider various perspectives on the nature of knowledge
    *   The ongoing debate about the limits of human knowledge
