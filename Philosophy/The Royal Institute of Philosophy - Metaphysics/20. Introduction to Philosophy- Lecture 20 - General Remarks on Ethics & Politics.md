### I. Introduction to Ethics and Political Philosophy
#### A. Historical Context and Premodern Conceptions of Human Nature

Ethics and politics are ancient subjects that have been addressed by philosophers since the time of Socrates. These questions concern how individuals and societies should behave and live, depending on one's conception of human nature. The premodern era had a distinct conception of human nature, emphasizing shared notions of purpose. This homogeneity made virtue ethics more plausible in these societies.

Virtue ethics concerns what constitutes a good life, often understood as excellence or flourishing. This concept relies on a common conception of human nature and purpose, making it more suitable for premodern societies. However, modern societies are diverse and cosmopolitan, making virtue ethics less likely to succeed in these contexts.

#### B. Modern Conceptions of Human Nature and Moral Theories

In contrast to the premodern era, modern societies have distinct conceptions of human nature, focusing on individual actions. This shift has led to the development of moral theories that provide rules for conduct. Two prominent moral theories are consequentialism and deontology.

- **Consequentialism**: This theory focuses on the consequences of actions, aiming to identify right and wrong characteristics in actions.
  - **Utilitarianism**: A prominent example of consequentialism, utilitarianism seeks to maximize overall happiness or well-being.
- **Deontology**: This theory emphasizes the importance of rules and duties, regardless of their consequences.
  - **Kant's Theory**: An example of deontology, Kant's theory focuses on the moral law and the categorical imperative.

#### C. Applied Ethics and Moral Deliberation

Applied ethicists engage with common moral intuitions that arise in ethically charged contexts, such as medical problems, animal treatment, or workplace dilemmas. Rather than applying theories to practices, their role is to develop and refine the moral sense through deliberation on these issues.

- **Key Aspects of Applied Ethics**:
  - Negotiating and managing shared moral responses
  - Developing a nuanced understanding of morality in practice
  - Hone a refined moral sense through deliberation on ethically charged contexts

#### D. Conclusion and Future Directions

The introduction to ethics and political philosophy has provided an overview of the historical context, premodern conceptions of human nature, and modern moral theories. The distinction between virtue ethics and moral theories has highlighted the importance of understanding human nature in different eras.

As we move forward, it is essential to consider the implications of these concepts on our daily lives and societal structures. By engaging with applied ethics and moral deliberation, we can develop a deeper understanding of morality in practice and refine our moral sense through negotiation and management of shared moral responses.
