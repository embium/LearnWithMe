### I. Introduction to Skepticism in the Appearance-Reality Gap
#### A. Overview of Descartes' Quest for Rational Grounds

Descartes continues his pursuit of rational grounds for human knowledge, having rejected sensory experience and deductive reasoning as foundations for knowledge. His quest is driven by a commitment to intellectual autonomy and the idea that human beings are fundamentally rational or reasonable. Despite the negative outcome of his first meditation, where neither sensory experience nor deductive reasoning could constitute the grounds for human knowledge, Descartes remains resolute in his pursuit.

#### B. Concerns about the Failure of Investigations

Descartes' concerns about the failure of his investigations are twofold: he worries that his inquiries may ultimately fail to provide a solid foundation for human knowledge, and he is aware that such a failure would have significant implications for conceptions of human nature and the relative standing of human beings in the order of creation.

### II. The Cogito Argument
#### A. Establishing Indubitable Knowledge

Descartes comes to a realization that there are two beliefs which survive all skeptical doubts: the belief that he is currently thinking and the belief that he currently exists. These beliefs cannot be doubted on any grounds, their truth being absolutely necessary and knowledge of them being absolutely indubitable. This insight is often referred to as the "Cogito" argument, where Descartes establishes a basic epistemological position stating that we can be absolutely certain about the contents of our own thoughts, which constitute the foundations of our knowledge.

#### B. The Significance of the Cogito

The Cogito argument has significant implications for understanding human knowledge and reality. It suggests that the only thing we can be absolutely certain about is our own mental states, and that these states are the foundation upon which all other knowledge claims must be built.

### III. Challenges to Descartes' Position
#### A. The Problem of Mismatch between Mental Picture and External World

Descartes faces two daunting challenges: to overcome the problem of mismatch between our mental picture of the world and the external world itself, and to justify the belief that there is any external world at all. While Descartes believes he has a solution to the second challenge, few have found it compelling.

#### B. Alternative Approaches to Justifying External World Beliefs

The course will pursue an alternative line, outlining the limits of rational inquiry and considering beliefs like the existence of the external world as starting assumptions rather than things to be proven. This approach recognizes that certain fundamental beliefs may be beyond the reach of rational justification, but are still essential for human knowledge and understanding.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Recapitulation of Key Points

In conclusion, Descartes' quest for rational grounds for human knowledge is driven by a commitment to intellectual autonomy and the idea that human beings are fundamentally rational or reasonable. His Cogito argument establishes indubitable knowledge about the contents of our own thoughts, but faces challenges in justifying the existence of an external world. The course will explore alternative approaches to understanding these challenges and the limits of rational inquiry.

#### B. Implications for Human Knowledge and Reality

The implications of Descartes' position are far-reaching, affecting conceptions of human nature and the relative standing of human beings in the order of creation. By recognizing the limits of rational inquiry, we may come to appreciate the importance of starting assumptions and fundamental beliefs that underlie our understanding of the world.
