### I. Introduction to Kant's Moral Philosophy
#### A. Overview of Deontological Ethics

Kant's moral philosophy presents a deontological approach that emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and the integrity of the human will. This perspective stands in contrast to utilitarianism, which prioritizes the general good and happiness. Kant's philosophy fills a void left by utilitarianism, focusing on the concept of a "good will" as the pinnacle of human fulfillment.

#### B. Key Assumptions about Human Nature

Kant assumes that humans are designed for morality, not happiness. He believes that reason is not well-suited to pursuing happiness and instead introduces deliberation and reflection, which can lead to pause and consideration of one's actions. This idea is central to Kant's philosophy and will be explored further in discussions on moral obligation and the good will.

#### C. The Role of Reason in Human Fulfillment

Kant argues that humans are "creatures of reason" who are poorly suited for pursuing happiness through instinct, like animals. He claims that when we use our rational minds to deliberate and pursue happiness, we become distracted and worry about the consequences, which can derail the pursuit of happiness altogether. In contrast, Kant believes that morality represents the fulfillment of human nature, and that our capacity for rational deliberation and reflection is best suited for identifying duty, not happiness.

### II. The Concept of a Good Will
#### A. Definition and Significance

A good will is a free rational will that acts from duty rather than desire. It represents the pinnacle of human fulfillment and is the only thing that is unconditionally good in Kant's philosophy. He argues that actions done from a sense of duty have moral worth, while acting from desire can lead to external causality and coercion.

#### B. Characteristics of a Good Will

Kant believes that a good will is characterized by its ability to act solely upon the dictates of its own rational will, without being influenced by desires or external factors. This idea is central to his conception of freedom and autonomy, which he believes is closely tied to morality.

### III. Freedom and Autonomy in Kant's Philosophy
#### A. The Importance of Moral Agency

Kant emphasizes the importance of moral agency and the ability to act from a sense of duty rather than desire. He believes that this capacity for rational deliberation and reflection is essential for identifying duty and making morally worthy decisions.

#### B. The Relationship between Freedom and Autonomy

Kant argues that true freedom is achieved when individuals act solely upon the dictates of their own rational will, without being influenced by desires or external factors. This idea is closely tied to his conception of morality and the importance of moral agency.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Summary of Key Points

Kant's moral philosophy presents a deontological approach that emphasizes individual autonomy and the integrity of the human will. He argues that humans are designed for morality, not happiness, and that our capacity for rational deliberation and reflection is best suited for identifying duty rather than pursuing happiness.

#### B. Implications for Moral Theory

Kant's philosophy fills a void left by utilitarianism and provides an alternative perspective on moral theory. His emphasis on the importance of moral agency, freedom, and autonomy has significant implications for our understanding of morality and human fulfillment.
