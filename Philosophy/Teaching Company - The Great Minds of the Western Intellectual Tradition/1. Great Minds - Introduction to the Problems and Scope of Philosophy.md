### I. Introduction to Western Intellectual History
#### A. Overview of Key Problems and Issues in Thought and High Culture

The lectures that follow cover three thousand years of Western intellectual history, focusing on key problems and issues in thought and high culture. This involves philosophy, a love of wisdom that goes beyond practical concerns and everyday knowledge. The Western intellectual tradition forms a coherent philosophic tradition with common problems, similar issues, and shared vocabulary.

#### B. Key Concepts and Terms

- **Physics**: Our theory of nature, explaining the world around us through sense perception.
- **Metaphysics**: Ideas or entities existing independently of space and time, like pure ideas or spiritual entities.
- **Ontology**: Speech about beings, distinguishing between kinds of existence and attributing different statuses to them.
- **Logic**: A system of rules for deriving true inferences, organizing thinking to get the right answer from true premises.
- **Epistemology**: The inquiry into knowledge itself, accounting for what we can know and how we can have knowledge of different things.
- **Aesthetics**: A theory of beauty, formalizing everyday thoughts about beauty and connecting them to other philosophical questions.
- **Ethics**: Investigates right and wrong, moral obligations, and judgments of value.
- **Politics or Political Theory**: Examines the organization of societies, governments, and justice.

#### C. The Two Fundamental Answers to "What is"

The Western intellectual tradition has two fundamental answers to the question "what is": nature (the world of space and time) and a second world external to our senses, containing eternal moral standards and justifying good and evil actions. These ontological positions underlie all remaining intellectuals in this series of lectures, influencing their views on ethics, politics, aesthetics, philosophy of mind, and epistemology.

#### D. The Central Traditions: Athens and Jerusalem

The Western tradition is formed by two central traditions:
- **Liberated Rationality and Human Freedom from Athens**: This tradition emphasizes human discourse over divine revelation, celebrating human hubris and the desire to transcend nature.
- **Reverence and Piety and Faith in God from Jerusalem**: This tradition emphasizes faith and obedience to God's will, even in the face of adversity.

#### E. The Concept of Logos

The concept of logos, or word, is central to biblical faith but has been distorted by its connotations from Greek philosophy. In the Gospel of John, logos refers to the fundamental reality and divine word that underlies all existence, distinct from the Greek notion of free untrammeled reason.

#### F. The Tension Between Athens and Jerusalem

This dichotomy raises questions about the virtues we value: do we aspire to be like Job, exemplifying faith and humility, or like Prometheus, embodying pride and a desire for divine power? The history of Western philosophy is marked by this tension between Athens and Jerusalem, with different philosophical discourses offering distinct pleasures and improvements.

#### G. Navigating the Complex Landscape

To navigate this complex landscape, it's essential to cultivate an open mind, question one's assumptions, and consider alternative perspectives. By engaging with the traditions of both Athens and Jerusalem, we can maximize our understanding and capacity for intellectual honesty, ultimately leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive worldview.

### II. Key Intellectual Discourses
#### A. The Tradition of Job

- **Faith and Obedience**: Emphasizes faith and obedience to God's will, even in the face of adversity.
- **Humility**: Values humility as a virtue, recognizing human limitations and dependence on divine guidance.

#### B. The Tradition of Prometheus

- **Human Hubris**: Celebrates human hubris and the desire to transcend nature.
- **Pride and Desire for Divine Power**: Emphasizes pride and the desire for divine power, often at the expense of humility and obedience.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. Cultivating Intellectual Honesty

To navigate the complex landscape of Western intellectual history, it's essential to cultivate an open mind, question one's assumptions, and consider alternative perspectives. By engaging with the traditions of both Athens and Jerusalem, we can maximize our understanding and capacity for intellectual honesty, ultimately leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive worldview.

#### B. Maximizing Understanding

- **Engage with Different Philosophical Discourses**: Consider different philosophical discourses and their contributions to Western intellectual history.
- **Question Assumptions**: Question one's assumptions and consider alternative perspectives to deepen understanding.
- **Cultivate Intellectual Honesty**: Cultivate an open mind and a willingness to engage in critical thinking, recognizing the complexity of human thought.
