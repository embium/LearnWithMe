### I. The Early Enlightenment Period (Before 1750)

#### A. Commitment to Naturalistic Metaphysics

The early Enlightenment period was characterized by a commitment to naturalistic metaphysics, also known as mechanistic materialism. This view of reality was largely based on the successes of Newtonian science, which looked to science as the means to all rational and possible knowledge. The scientific revolution sparked a desire to apply the same techniques to understanding humanity itself, giving rise to the concept of "the science of man." This approach took two forms: one focused on categorizing human behavior through scientific psychology, while the other sought to understand historical causation.

The emphasis on naturalistic metaphysics led to a focus on empirical observation and experimentation as the primary means of acquiring knowledge. This approach was seen as a way to overcome traditional authority and superstition, and to establish a more rational and scientific understanding of the world.

#### B. The Science of Man

The concept of "the science of man" emerged during this period, with two main approaches:

*   **Scientific Psychology**: This approach focused on categorizing human behavior through empirical observation and experimentation. It sought to understand human nature and behavior in a more scientific and systematic way.
*   **Historical Causation**: This approach sought to understand historical events and developments as the result of natural causes, rather than supernatural or divine intervention.

#### C. Critique of Cartesian Epistemology

The early Enlightenment period also saw a critique of Cartesian epistemology, which precluded the possibility of history being a science due to its reliance on clear and distinct concepts. John Bautista Vico's work in "The New Science" challenged this view, arguing that history can be a science and known with scientific certainty.

### II. John Bautista Vico's Theory of History

#### A. Cyclical Model of Human Development

Vico's theory of history involves a cyclical model, where each cycle represents a distinct stage in human development, from primitive man to the city-state. The first age is characterized by a beastly creature, barely outside the animal state, with fundamental proclivities being instinctual and aggressive.

#### B. Stages of Human Development

Vico's theory highlights the importance of understanding historical development through a study of human cognitive growth and the mechanisms that drive change over time. The concept of vassalage, a bond of fealty and protection, marked the beginning of a cycle of human development.

The stages of human development according to Vico are:

*   **Age of Heroes**: This stage saw the emergence of patriarchs who provided protection to refugees, creating aristocratic commonwealths that were exclusive to them. These patriarchs were considered heroes, sons of the gods, and their order was hercules, who founded every city in Greece according to myth.
*   **Age of Men**: This stage saw the slow but sure fight for rights by plebeians, which went through three stages: obtaining the right to solemnize marriages, citizenship, and eventually holding office in the state. This age recognized human equality based on shared rationality, leading to the rise of democratic republics and high cultural institutions like academies and philosophy.
*   **Age of Ambitious Leaders**: This stage saw the emergence of ambitious leaders who restored order through monarchies with civil rights, but ultimately led to decadence and destruction.

#### C. Implications of Vico's Theory

Vico's theory implies that each stage gives rise to its successor, and history teaches us about the psychological nature of man, showing him as a sensual creature, a creative figure, and finally a rational animal. This understanding allows us to see ourselves and our potential, and to plan governments accordingly, taking into account the level of development of a culture and nation.

### III. Conclusion

The early Enlightenment period was characterized by a commitment to naturalistic metaphysics and the concept of "the science of man." Vico's theory of history provides a cyclical model of human development, highlighting the importance of understanding historical development through a study of human cognitive growth and the mechanisms that drive change over time.

This approach allows us to see ourselves and our potential, and to plan governments accordingly, taking into account the level of development of a culture and nation.
