### I. The Life and Times of George Berkeley
#### A. Overview of Berkeley's Life and Work

George Berkeley was an Anglican bishop born around the time of England's Glorious Revolution (1688-1689). He lived for approximately 70 years, during which he developed a philosophical perspective that would significantly influence the intellectual landscape. As a pioneering critic of the Enlightenment, Berkeley is often regarded as the first romantic thinker to react against its hyper-rationalism.

#### B. Critique of Mechanistic Materialism and Empiricism

Berkeley's ideas were shaped by his critique of mechanistic materialism and empiricism. He argued that abstract ideas are impossible, as all knowledge arises from sense experience and is comprised of particular ideas. This perspective led him to conclude that matter is a posit, not an actual entity, but rather a substratum for ideas.

**Key Concept:** _Empiricist absolute idealism_ refers to Berkeley's philosophical stance that the world consists solely of minds and their ideas, with God serving as the universal switchboard of ideas.

#### C. The Nature of Reality According to Berkeley

Berkeley posited that objects in the world are sensible particular objects, imposed on us by our conceptual scheme. He questioned the explanatory power of Newtonian physics, suggesting it merely describes law-like regularities without truly explaining anything. This critique highlights the tension between scientific description and underlying explanation.

**Example:** The concept of gravity, as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation, has long been a topic of interest. However, the question remains: what causes objects to fall at a rate of 32 feet per second squared? Berkeley would argue that science merely describes regularities in our ideas and experiences, without providing any underlying explanation for these phenomena.

#### D. Materialism vs. Idealism

Berkeley argued that materialism is not only the source of skepticism but also atheism, as it posits an unknowable and occult substratum matter that causes experience and regularities in the world. In contrast, idealism offers a more straightforward and liberating perspective, where ideas are the fundamental reality, and God's presence is felt directly through our experiences.

**Key Concept:** _Idealism_ refers to the philosophical stance that ideas or minds are the fundamental reality, rather than matter or physical objects.

#### E. Influence on Anglo-American Thought

Berkeley's philosophy has had a profound influence on thinkers like Samuel Johnson, who responded to his ideas with a critique that ultimately failed to refute them. Instead, it highlighted the tension between philosophical speculation and common sense notions. This tension marks a turning point in Anglo-American thought, as philosophers begin to move towards a more practical and intuitive approach, preserving technicality while acknowledging its limitations.

**Key Concept:** _Romanticism_ refers to the intellectual movement that emerged in response to the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and rationality. Berkeley's ideas are often seen as a precursor to this movement.
