### I. Thomas More: A True Renaissance Man
#### A. Early Life and Career

Thomas More was a 16th-century English representative of the Northern Renaissance, known for his piety, devotion, and integrity. He was a true Renaissance man - a Christian saint who excelled in various fields, including politics, diplomacy, literature, and philosophy.

- **Member of Parliament**: More served as a member of Parliament, where he demonstrated his skills as a diplomat and ambassador.
- **Lord Chancellor**: He also held the position of Lord Chancellor, making him one of the most influential figures in English politics at that time.
- **Scholar and Writer**: As a great scholar and writer, More's work had a significant impact on Western literature. His book "Utopia" is particularly famous for its precursor to communism, but it's more accurately seen as the last great Christian synthesis.

#### B. The Utopian Society in "Utopia"

In his book "Utopia," Thomas More presents a society where people live in harmony, work together, and have leisure time for cultural enrichment. This utopian society is modeled after Plato's Republic but with a distinctly Christian twist.

- **Key Features**:
  - No private property
  - All production located within the household
  - Utopian government based on councils and committees
  - Decision-making power rests with the community rather than individual leaders

#### C. Governance and Justice in the Utopian Society

The utopian society described by More has a unique approach to governance and justice.

- **Meritocratic System**: The system of governance is meritocratic, with rulers chosen through testing.
- **Social Mobility**: Social mobility is available to all, allowing individuals to rise through the ranks based on their abilities.
- **Crime and Punishment**: The utopians have a remarkable approach to crime and punishment. They execute violent or serious offenders while showing mercy to those who demonstrate remorse.

#### D. Foreign Policy and Trade

The utopian society has a distinct foreign policy, focusing on defending their territory, allies, or oppressed peoples.

- **No Signed Treaties**: The utopians do not sign treaties; instead, they rely on trust and the humanity of their adversaries.
- **Trade and Commerce**: Their trade and commerce focus on acquiring iron, which they lack. They also engage in extensive trade, using gold and silver primarily for decorative purposes.

#### E. Morality and Ethics

The utopians have a unique moral theory that prioritizes happiness and pleasure.

- **Eudaimonistic Theory**: Their moral theory is eudaimonistic, focusing on individual happiness and pleasure.
- **Types of Pleasures**: They recognize two types of pleasures: mental (contemplating truth, reading philosophy) and physical (organic release, health itself).
- **No Harm to Others**: The utopians argue that true natural pleasures do not hurt others and have no nasty aftereffects.

#### F. Conclusion

Thomas More's vision of a utopian society is not just a pipe dream; it's a legitimate form of Christian social reconstruction that could be implemented in England, where he had been a member of Parliament. His work "Utopia" remains an important contribution to Western literature and philosophy, offering insights into governance, justice, morality, and ethics.
