### I. Existentialism: A Philosophical Movement
#### A. Historical Roots and Precursors

Existentialism emerged from continental 20th-century thought, with its roots in the 19th century. Key precursors to existentialism were Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, who shared a commonality as individuals choosing and judging independently of others' opinions or previously received rationality. Both emphasized moral heroism, confronting a chaotic world with choices lacking clear criteria, and agonizing over human existence's uncertainty.

Kierkegaard and Nietzsche's emphasis on individual choice and the agony of decision-making is central to 20th-century existentialism. Their ideas laid the groundwork for later philosophers to explore the concept of human freedom and responsibility in the face of uncertainty.

#### B. Martin Heidegger: Being in Time

Martin Heidegger's philosophy stands out as a significant contribution to existentialism. His work, particularly "Being in Time," explores the concept of "design" – the mode of human existence in the world, characterized by judgments, commitments, and connections. Heidegger seeks to articulate what it means to be human, acknowledging that this inquiry leads to fundamental questions with no satisfactory answers.

Heidegger's philosophy critiques Western philosophy for its tendency towards pseudo-solutions, instead advocating for confronting the fact that there are no ultimate grounds for judgments or actions. This uncertainty is a hallmark of existentialism.

#### C. Jean-Paul Sartre: Human Freedom and Responsibility

Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy is an extrapolation from Heidegger's ideas, more accessible and readable. Sartre emphasizes human freedom as the essence of being human, condemning us to make choices with no logical grounding. This freedom is what makes us different from other beings in the world, and it is our responsibility to be authentic, dealing with the ambiguity and anxiety that accompanies this freedom.

Sartre's concept of "being in nothingness" further develops Heidegger's idea of being in time, distinguishing between things-in-themselves (objects) and things-for-themselves (conscious human subjects). Sartre insists on our freedom, even if it seems to be an illusion, as a way of escaping the burden of making agonizing choices with no fundamental ground.

#### D. Existentialism: Key Themes and Ideas

Existentialism emphasizes individual choice, moral heroism, and the agony of decision-making in a chaotic world. Heidegger's philosophy critiques Western philosophy for its tendency towards pseudo-solutions, advocating instead for confronting the uncertainty and ambiguity of human existence.

Sartre's philosophy builds upon Heidegger's ideas, emphasizing human freedom as the essence of being human and our responsibility to be authentic in the face of this freedom. Existentialism seeks to reconcile moral theory with the simple facts of the 20th century: uncertainty, misery, and chaos.

#### E. Critique of Determinism and Pseudo-Solutions

Existentialists like Sartre reject the idea of God's existence, arguing that people invent religious myths to avoid making decisions without ground. Instead, they emphasize human freedom and responsibility, acknowledging that there are no moral rules or universal truths.

This perspective is reflected in Sartre's treatment of psychoanalysis, which he sees as an example of bad faith, allowing individuals to attribute their behavior to deterministic factors rather than taking responsibility for their choices. Existentialists like Sartre also draw parallels with the Greek myth of Prometheus, who shakes his fist at the lack of meaning in the world but refuses to ground it in pseudo-solutions.

#### F. Subjectivization of Morality and Politics

Existentialism is primarily a literary movement, as seen in the works of Samuel Beckett, Albert Camus, and others, which effectively convey the themes of existentialism through poetic communication rather than logical description. This tendency to emphasize subjectivity, heroism, and uncertainty has its roots in 19th-century romanticism, which rejected logic and reason in favor of sentiment and emotion.

Existentialism revives this tendency with a vengeance, leading to a revival of romanticism in the 20th century. Ultimately, existentialism demands that we live up to the limited, inadequate, and unsatisfactory potentials of being human beings in an age of science and a world of machines, advocating for the poetic over the rational as a significant and sincere cry of the heart.
