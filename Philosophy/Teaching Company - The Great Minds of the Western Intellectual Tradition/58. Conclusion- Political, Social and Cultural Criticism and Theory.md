### I. The Collapse of Universality in 20th Century Moral and Political Discourse
#### A. Nietzsche's Challenge to Traditional Metaphysics and Ethics

The 20th century saw a significant shift in the way thinkers approached morality and politics, marked by a collapse of universality. Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas played a crucial role in this development. His famous statement "God is dead" undermined traditional metaphysics and ethics, reducing them to aesthetic judgments of taste. This led to a relativistic view of morality, where individual perspectives became the sole basis for moral decisions.

In essence, Nietzsche's philosophy suggests that there are no objective moral truths; instead, individuals create their own values based on personal preferences and desires. This perspective has far-reaching implications for politics, as it reduces the domain of politics to an exclusive realm of the will to power. Individuals then advance projects that gratify their own desires rather than seeking universal truths.

#### B. Freud's Contribution to Fragmentation in Communication and Knowledge

Sigmund Freud's work further complicated communication and knowledge by introducing the idea that our understanding of ourselves is inherently fragmented and uncertain. This fragmentation extends to society and politics, making it difficult to form coherent discourses about the self or the world.

The postmodern notion that there can be no overarching legitimizing metanarratives reflects this fragmentation. In other words, there are no grand narratives or universal truths that can unite people across different cultures and societies. Instead, we are left with a multitude of fragmented perspectives, each with its own truth claims.

#### C. The Impact of Cybernetic Technology on Contemporary Challenges

The advent of cybernetic technology has introduced new problems for contemporary thinkers, including issues related to global warming, economic development, and the distribution of wealth. These challenges raise questions about the feasibility of equality on a global scale and the potential need to reevaluate values in light of technological advancements.

#### D. Philosophical Critiques of Technology

Philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, and Michel Foucault have offered critiques of technology, with some viewing it as a distraction from authentic human experience or an oppressive means by which elites impose their will on others. Habermas has countered that technology can be liberating if used to extend communicative rationality.

#### E. The Debate Surrounding Science and Technology in Society

The debate surrounding the role of science and technology in society continues, with some arguing that they serve only the interests of the elite and others seeing them as potentially liberating forces. The tension between these perspectives reflects a deeper concern about the impact of technological advancements on human freedom and the distribution of power.

#### F. The Role of Intellectuals in Society

The notion of intellectuals as a separate social class has been proposed, with some arguing that they pursue their own interests at the expense of the public good. Alvin Gouldner's concept of intellectuals as an elite that owns conceptual capital is seen by some as a power play to take control of the state and gratify their will to power.

However, this idea raises questions about the morality of intellectuals, who are often perceived as being more public-spirited than others. The postmodernist tradition is also viewed as a means for intellectuals to delegitimize other alternatives and establish themselves as the only ones capable of making moral and political judgments.

#### G. The Sociology of Knowledge: Intellectuals' Alienation and Resentment

The sociology of knowledge reveals that intellectuals have become incredibly provincial and conventional, occupying a small and truncated spectrum of political and moral thought, which they justify through their own alienation and resentment. This sentiment leads them to adopt a negative antagonistic stance towards technology, science, and theory.

Ultimately, the collapse of universality in 20th century moral and political discourse has led to a complex web of challenges and debates surrounding the role of intellectuals, technology, and science in society.
