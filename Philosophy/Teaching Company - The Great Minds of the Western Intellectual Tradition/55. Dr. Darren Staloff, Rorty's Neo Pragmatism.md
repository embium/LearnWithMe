### I. The Evolution of Philosophy in the Modern Era
#### A. Background and Influences

This philosopher has made significant contributions to the current cultural scene over the past 25 years, establishing himself as a leading figure in philosophy and cultural criticism. His work draws on the insights of influential thinkers such as Willard Van Orman Quine, Wilfred Sellars, and Donald Davidson, among others. This philosophical tradition seeks to move post-analytic American philosophy towards a more pragmatic direction.

#### B. Key Concepts: Pragmatism and Democracy

The philosopher's work is deeply informed by democracy, naturalism, tolerance, and intellectual openness. He argues that both continental and American analytic traditions are headed towards pragmatism, with William James as a key influence. This emphasis on pragmatism highlights the importance of practical experience and experimentation in shaping our understanding of the world.

#### C. Critique of Modern Philosophy

The philosopher critiques the modern philosophical tradition, which he sees as centered around capital-T truth and capital-R reality. He advocates for a return to "little-p" philosophy, little-t truth, and little-r reality, emphasizing the importance of context and contingency in shaping our understanding of the world.

#### D. The Role of Conceptual Schemes

The philosopher argues that conceptual schemes are historically contingent and subject to change. This challenges the idea of a fixed or objective reality, instead highlighting the role of language and culture in shaping our perceptions of the world.

#### E. Critique of the Correspondence Theory of Truth

The philosopher critiques the correspondence theory of truth, arguing that language is part of the world and that the connection between our linguistic usages and other phenomena is purely causal. This challenges traditional notions of truth as a fixed or objective concept.

#### F. Edifying Discourses: A Post-Philosophical Approach

The philosopher advocates for a post-philosophical foundational approach, which he calls "edifying discourses." This approach seeks to show how his own pragmatic discourses hang together with contemporary democratic projects in the West.

#### G. The Role of Irony and Self-Creation

In a postmodern, liberal society, the strong poet is the hero, not the traditional scientist or thinker. The philosopher argues that individuals can redescribe themselves and others in new ways, creating contingency, irony, and solidarity. Ironists are people who realize the contingency of their final vocabularies - the words they use to describe their lives and values.

#### H. The Evolving Role of the Philosopher

The philosopher's role is evolving, shifting from a master figure to a cultural critic who connects and draws together different disciplines and fields. This new role involves being an eclectic, reading widely across various subjects, and discussing how they intersect or diverge.

#### I. A Utopian Society: Self-Creation and Fulfillment

In this utopian society, each person becomes their own cultural critic, making themselves lovers of wisdom and philosophers through private projects of self-creation and fulfillment. This emphasizes the importance of individual agency and creativity in shaping our understanding of the world.
