### I. Introduction to Arthur Schopenhauer
#### A. Overview of His Life and Philosophy

Arthur Schopenhauer was a unique and influential German philosopher of the 19th century, known for his pessimistic views on life. Despite his work being unpleasant and dour, his writing style is sprightly and contrasts with the content, making him comparable to Friedrich Nietzsche. Although not widely read today, he's worth studying due to his influence on thinkers like Freud, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche.

Schopenhauer's family background significantly shaped his philosophy, particularly his father's suicide and mother's coldness, which contributed to his negative view of the world. His work is characterized by a pessimistic eastern strain, combining elements of Hinduism and Buddhism with German idealism. He inverts prior philosophies in unique ways, often resulting in surprising and intriguing ideas.

#### B. Key Works and Influences

Schopenhauer's main work, "The World as Will and Representation," is a symphony in four movements that explores the distinction between subject and object, formulating the problem of the self and its deepest spiritual implications. He argues that we can never know the external world as it truly is, but only through the a priori forms imposed by our minds.

However, he claims that our own self-consciousness, or will, is directly apprehensible, leading to a pessimistic view of human beings as desiring animals subject to a mysterious and uncontrollable force. This idea has significant consequences for the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing thinkers like Nietzsche and Freud.

### II. The Problem of the Self
#### A. The Distinction Between Subject and Object

Schopenhauer's philosophy faces us with a problem: what are we, and how can we deal with the difficulties of the world? He proposes that our understanding of reality is filtered through the a priori forms imposed by our minds, making it impossible to know the external world as it truly is.

#### B. The Will and Human Existence

Schopenhauer argues that our own self-consciousness, or will, is directly apprehensible, leading to a pessimistic view of human beings as desiring animals subject to a mysterious and uncontrollable force. This idea has significant consequences for the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing thinkers like Nietzsche and Freud.

### III. Aesthetics and Asceticism
#### A. Redemption through Art

Schopenhauer proposes two ways out: through aesthetics, which offers redemption through artistic objectivity, or through asceticism, which involves renouncing desires and seeking release from the veil of maya. He believes that art, particularly aesthetics, offers a fleeting moment of objectivity, but ultimately, the world is a meaningless and chaotic place where suffering is an inherent part of life.

#### B. The Importance of Asceticism

Schopenhauer's views on asceticism involve denying one's desires and will, which he sees as the key to achieving release from the veil of maya. This idea has been influential in the development of existentialist thought, with many philosophers drawing on his ideas about the importance of commitment and authenticity.

### IV. Tragedy and Human Existence
#### A. The Nature of True Tragedy

Schopenhauer's views on tragedy are also noteworthy, as he believes that true tragedy should be about an average person facing a terrible catastrophe without any fault of their own, rather than a heroic figure with a fatal flaw.

### V. Legacy and Influence
#### A. Impact on German Philosophy

Schopenhauer's ideas have been influential in the development of German philosophy, particularly in the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. His emphasis on the will over intellect has also had a significant impact on existentialist thought, with many philosophers drawing on his ideas about the importance of commitment and authenticity.

#### B. Continued Relevance Today

Despite his pessimistic views, Schopenhauer's philosophy remains a crucial part of the Western philosophical tradition, offering insights into the human condition that continue to resonate today.
