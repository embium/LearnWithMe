### I. Edmund Burke: A Pragmatic Thinker in Politics
#### A. Overview of Edmund Burke's Career and Philosophy

Edmund Burke was an influential figure in the history of philosophy, known for his practical approach to politics rather than theoretical scholarship. As a member of the House of Commons and a Rockingham Whig, he dedicated his career to understanding the connection between political theory and practice. His primary concern was to identify what works in practice, not just in theory, particularly under democratic legislatures.

#### B. Investigating the Connection Between Theory and Practice

Burke sought to comprehend how legislatures functioned, what ideals they should be connected with, and how political theory should inform practice. He believed that theories should be tested in practice; if they didn't work, they were bad theories. This pragmatic approach led him to advocate for gradual, piecemeal reforms, recognizing the need to balance empirical interests with political stability.

#### C. Key Influences on Burke's Views

Burke's experiences growing up in Ireland and being an outsider in politics influenced his views on reform and stability. His support for the American Revolution and investigation of corrupt practices among the East India Company demonstrate his commitment to reform-mindedness, despite often being seen as a conservative thinker.

#### D. Burke's Position on Reform and Stability

As a Whig, Burke supported the country party against the court party and advocated for reform without revolution. His skepticism towards utopian thoughts and radical democratic tendencies led him to anticipate the rise of a despotic figure like Napoleon following the French Revolution. This perspective emphasizes the importance of empiricism in evaluating the effectiveness of reforms.

#### E. Empiricism and Gradual Change

Burke believed in gradual change, citing the English constitution as an example of a system that had evolved over time through tradition and practice rather than abstract theory. He opposed radical reforms, arguing that they were inherently skeptical and conservative, and that skepticism was essential to minimizing risk and promoting human felicity.

#### F. Critique of Radical Reforms

The idea of reforming society through legislation, as exemplified by prohibition, often fails due to its impracticality. Edmund Burke's conservative perspective emphasizes the importance of empiricism in evaluating the effectiveness of reforms, rather than relying solely on theory. He argues that certain types of reforms, such as democratization and abolition of slavery, may be inherently flawed or even counterproductive.

#### G. Views on Faction and Party

Burke initially saw factions and parties as evil, but later came to accept their necessity in a representative legislature. His concept of virtual representation, where representatives prioritize the interests of society over those of specific localities or groups, is undemocratic but may provide a broader perspective for lawmakers.

#### H. Legacy and Impact

Burke's pragmatic approach to politics, which prioritizes understanding how things work in practice over adherence to theory, makes him a worthy heir to the English skeptical empirical tradition. His ideas continue to influence contemporary debates on reform, stability, and the role of empiricism in evaluating the effectiveness of policies.
