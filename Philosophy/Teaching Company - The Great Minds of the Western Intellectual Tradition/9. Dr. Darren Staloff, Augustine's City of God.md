### I. The Christian Synthetic Philosophy
#### A. Historical Context and Emergence

The Christian synthetic philosophy, as expressed by Saint Augustine of Hippo, provides a profound and enduring theological framework. Born in 354 AD, Augustine hailed from North Africa and gave the first philosophic expression to Christian doctrine. He remains a source of inspiration for contemplation and reflection, offering answers to fundamental religious questions and cosmic concerns.

During the decline of the Roman Empire, people sought broader venues for meaning, leading to the emergence of world religions like Christianity, Stoicism, Mithraism, Manichaeanism, and Neoplatonism. Augustine dabbled in these philosophies but ultimately became a Christian. The rise of Christianity as a great world religion is not coincidental, emerging at a time when Rome was falling apart.

#### B. Syncretism with Neoplatonism

Augustine's version of the Christian synthesis answers fundamental questions, representing a synthesis of rational speculation and faith. He saw his Christian synthesis as an attempt to put the best parts of both together, appealing to the mind like Greek philosophies but also to the spirit.

The particular form of Augustine's synthesis was a syncretism of Neoplatonism, which he claimed to be a Platonist. He mixed Plato's wisdom with the wisdom of Jerusalem, baptizing Plato by saying his ideas were really about what Christians talk about. For Plato, the ultimate state of being is the Form of the Good, which is a form of cosmic optimism.

Augustine argues that this is actually the Judeo-Christian God. Each particular essence or form emanates from the Form of the Good, so in the Christian synthesis, each essence we find in the world emanates from God's mind. This answers Plato's question about where exactly the Form of Chairness exists, and it works nicely with the First Genesis myth, where God creates by speech, logos.

#### C. Divine Omnipotence and Creation

The big difference is that Augustine clearly expresses that God not only creates form but also matter, creating everything out of nothing, showing divine omnipotence. This concept has significant implications for understanding the nature of creation and the role of God in the universe.

### II. The Concept of Prudence
#### A. Definition and Importance

The concept of prudence, as exemplified by Augustine's philosophy, is a fundamental human value that emphasizes the importance of caution and humility. It involves recognizing one's own limitations and uncertainties, and being willing to question one's own assumptions and biases.

This approach is in contrast to the more dogmatic and rationalistic views that often lead to violence and intolerance. The idea of prudence is not just a moral or philosophical concept, but also has practical implications for governance and social organization.

#### B. Practical Implications

In fact, it was the presence of this ethos in American culture that contributed to its relative stability and lack of bloodshed during the Revolution, as opposed to other revolutions where mass executions and violence were more common. The tradition of prudence is not unique to America, however, but is also found in Calvinist nations such as England.

#### C. Tolerance and Open-Mindedness

This approach to life values the importance of being cautious and open-minded, recognizing that one's own understanding may be limited and that others may have valid perspectives. As David Hume, an agnostic philosopher, noted, it is best not to be dogmatic and to be willing to listen to opposing views, even if they seem crazy at first.

This tolerant culture grows out of an Augustinian strain of piety and a certain metaphysical posture that values humility and caution over certainty and dogma.
