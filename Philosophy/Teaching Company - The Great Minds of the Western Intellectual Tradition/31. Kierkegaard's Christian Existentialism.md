### I. Kierkegaard's Reaction to Hegelian Synthesis
#### A. Critique of Hegel's Systematic Approach

Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy is a direct response to the Hegelian synthesis, which posits that philosophy had reached its ultimate purpose with the comprehensive system of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Kierkegaard was deeply critical of the smug certainty and megalomaniacal comprehensiveness of the Hegelian system, particularly its attempt to reconcile reason and faith in a way that he found inconsistent with his own experience.

Kierkegaard's critique of Hegel can be summarized as follows:

*   **Rejection of Systematic Approach**: Kierkegaard rejected the idea that human existence could be completely systematized. He believed that the problems arose from the mixture of Greek rationality and biblical faith, which he saw as incompatible.
*   **Undermining Reason**: By reformulating the problem of connecting faith and reason, Kierkegaard effectively undermined reason and became a modern Job-like figure who would not blaspheme or be skeptical of God's wisdom.

#### B. The Aesthetic and Ethical Lives

Kierkegaard believed that individual human beings must make a choice between the aesthetic life (pursuing pleasure) and the ethical life (following moral rules for their own sake). He argued that this decision was criterionless, meaning there were no rational grounds for making it.

The two possible choices presented in Kierkegaard's book "Either/Or" are:

*   **Aesthetic Life**: The aesthetic man is one who is distracted from distraction by distraction, constantly pursuing new experiences and sensations to avoid boredom.
*   **Ethical Life**: In contrast, the moral man follows the dictates of conscience and morality out of passion for virtue, not because it makes sense.

#### C. Faith and Reason

Kierkegaard's views on faith and reason are exemplified in his interpretation of the biblical story of Abraham, who was asked to sacrifice his son Isaac as a test of faith. Kierkegaard saw this as a horrifying choice that required a passionate commitment to righteousness independent of rationality or pleasure.

In contrast, Immanuel Kant had a more nuanced view of the story, seeing it as an example of the limits of human reason in the face of divine command.

#### D. Subjectivity and Existentialism

Kierkegaard's philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on individual experience and subjective truth, which sets him apart from the Enlightenment thinkers who emphasized reason and objectivity.

His views on faith and reason are deeply rooted in his own personal experiences and struggles with doubt and uncertainty. In the realm of philosophy, particularly in the context of Immanuel Kant's ideas, there exists a notion that even if God were to appear and command us to do something, we would need to verify whether it aligns with the categorical imperative.

This rationalistic approach posits that God, being perfectly rational and free, would always adhere to this moral principle. However, Søren Kierkegaard's perspective on faith diverges from this view. He suggests that true religious faith involves a leap of faith, where one must make choices without the guidance of reason or objective criteria.

This either-or approach is exemplified in his interpretation of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of faith, rather than a rational decision. Kierkegaard's philosophy emphasizes subjectivity and the importance of personal experience over objective truth, resonating with existentialist thinkers like Heidegger and Sartre.

His ideas on the human condition, emphasizing the existence of moral confusion and the need for subjective choices without a rational decision procedure, offer a grim yet thought-provoking perspective on life.
