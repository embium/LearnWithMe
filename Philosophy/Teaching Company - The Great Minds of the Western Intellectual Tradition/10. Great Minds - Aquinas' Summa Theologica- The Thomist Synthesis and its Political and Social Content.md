### I. Thomas Aquinas: A Synthesizer of Medieval Philosophy
#### A. Overview of Tomism and Its Significance

Thomas Aquinas was a pivotal figure in medieval philosophy, bridging the Greco-Roman and Christian traditions through his synthesis of classical pagan learning into Christianity. As an Italian Dominican priest, he spent most of his career teaching at the University of Paris, where the Catholic Church dominated Western Europe's culture during the Middle Ages. Aquinas' approach was not revolutionary but rather a pathfinder who brought together disparate intellectual traditions, including Aristotle's works, which were being rediscovered in the West.

#### B. The Eclecticism of Tomism

Aquinas' synthesis was remarkable for its eclecticism, as he drew upon various classical authors, including Aristotle, Plato, and Cicero, while also mastering Christian theology and philosophy. His work, particularly the Summa Theologica, is an encyclopedic masterpiece that covers every conceivable problem in morals, politics, theology, physics, and ethics. Aquinas' achievement was more synthetic than creative, as he absorbed and synthesized a complex intellectual tradition into something intellectually coherent.

#### C. Key Concepts: Nominalism and Realism

The concept of dogness, or what it means to be a dog, raises questions about nominalism and realism. Some argue that the former's emphasis on individual characteristics is too narrow, while others see the latter's focus on universal forms as overly broad. Thomas Aquinas' approach synthesizes elements of both perspectives, acknowledging the importance of individual characteristics while also recognizing the existence of universal principles.

#### D. The Great Chain of Being and Its Implications

Aquinas' ontological doctrine, the great chain of being, organizes all existing reality into a hierarchical structure with God at the top. This idea has significant implications for political theory, as it legitimates authority based on divine ordination rather than human consent. Aquinas prefers a mixed polity, similar to Aristotle's, but one that is governed by the king through the grace of God.

#### E. Contributions to the Theory of Law

Aquinas' contributions to the theory of law are also noteworthy, particularly his distinction between eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. The idea of natural law has had a profound influence on Western culture, serving as a foundation for concepts like conscientious objection and civil disobedience.

#### F. Relevance in Contemporary Debates

The Nuremberg trials demonstrate the importance of natural law in international justice, as the accused were held accountable for crimes that violated universal moral principles rather than specific national laws. This example highlights the ongoing relevance of natural law arguments in contemporary philosophical debates about morality, politics, and human rights.

### II. Key Works: The Summa Contra Gentiles and the Summa Theologica
#### A. Overview of Aquinas' Greatest Works

Aquinas' greatest works, the Summa Contra Gentiles and the Summa Theologica, are vast and technical treatises that demonstrate his encyclopedic knowledge and systematic approach to philosophy. While they may be daunting, certain sections of these works are particularly relevant to contemporary philosophical concerns.

#### B. Five Ways of Demonstrating God's Existence

Aquinas' five ways of demonstrating God's existence, which include the prime mover argument, the efficient cause argument, and the idea of perfection, remain influential in philosophical theology.

### III. Legacy and Impact
#### A. Influence on Western Culture

The ideas of Thomas Aquinas have had a profound influence on Western culture, shaping concepts like conscientious objection, civil disobedience, and natural law. His synthesis of classical pagan learning into Christianity has left an enduring legacy in the fields of philosophy, theology, and politics.

#### B. Relevance in Contemporary Debates

Aquinas' ideas continue to be relevant in contemporary debates about morality, politics, and human rights. The Nuremberg trials demonstrate the importance of natural law in international justice, highlighting the ongoing relevance of Aquinas' arguments in modern philosophical discussions.
