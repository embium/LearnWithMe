### I. Introduction to Logical Positivism
#### A. Historical Context

Logical positivism emerged as a 20th-century philosophical movement reacting to two significant phenomena: the proliferation of speculative metaphysical systems following Kant's era and a revolution in symbolic logic that began in the 19th century with Cantor's work. This latter development led to breakthroughs in propositional calculus, truth tables, and Principia Mathematica by Russell and Whitehead, which aimed to turn all mathematics into a derivation of pure logic.

The positivists sought to preserve philosophy and bring it forward into a new scientific age, hence the term "positivism," meaning pro-science. They believed that metaphysics was literally nonsense, as it claimed to give extra scientific knowledge without fulfilling the criteria of verifiability for factual statements. Metaphysical sentences were seen as linguistic expressions without cognitive content, neither true nor false.

#### B. Key Features and Criticisms

- **Verifiability Criterion**: The positivists argued that all literally meaningful sentences express propositions, which are either analytic or synthetic. Analytic propositions have no factual content and are true by fiat, while synthetic propositions can be tested for their validity through observation.
- **Critique of Metaphysics**: The positivists analyzed traditional philosophic fields like ethics and theology, arguing that they are not concerned with factual content but rather with expressing feelings and values. This critique is based on the idea that ethical judgments have no factual meaning and are simply expressions of personal opinion.

#### C. Implications for Philosophy

The philosopher argues that philosophy should work as the handmaiden for science, clarifying concepts and showing how they are used in scientific theories. This view sees philosophy as developing into the logic of science, rather than being separate from it.

### II. The Critique of Metaphysics
#### A. Analyzing Traditional Philosophic Fields

The positivists analyzed traditional philosophic fields like ethics and theology, arguing that they are not concerned with factual content but rather with expressing feelings and values. This critique is based on the idea that ethical judgments have no factual meaning and are simply expressions of personal opinion.

- **Ethics**: The philosopher argues that ethical judgments proper express neither analytic nor synthetic propositions but are rather absolute and irreducible, with no provability or scientific basis.
- **Theology**: The philosopher further argues that theology is impossible to prove demonstratively, as empirical propositions are uncertain and a priori grounds lead only to tautologies.

#### B. Implications for the Concept of the Self

The positivist critique extends to the concept of the self, which is seen as a logical construction out of sense experience, rather than a metaphysical substance.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. Philosophy's Role in Science

The philosopher concludes by suggesting that philosophy should work as the handmaiden for science, clarifying concepts and showing how they are used in scientific theories. This view sees philosophy as developing into the logic of science, rather than being separate from it.
