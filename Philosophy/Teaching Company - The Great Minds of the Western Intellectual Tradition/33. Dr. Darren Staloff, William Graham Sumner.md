### I. The Emergence of Social Darwinism
#### A. Overview of the Concept

Social Darwinism was a revolutionary ideology that emerged in the 19th century, applying Charles Darwin's principles of natural selection to human society. This movement challenged traditional Christian morality and the notion of humanity as a distinct creation, instead viewing humans as part of nature, subject to the same laws and struggles as other species.

#### B. Key Principles and Influences

Social Darwinism posited that society should be organized like nature, with individuals competing for survival and resources in a struggle for existence. This idea was deeply influential in late 19th century America, where it was used to justify laissez-faire capitalism and the concentration of wealth among industrialists.

*   **William Graham Sumner's Views**: As a prominent social darwinist, William Graham Sumner argued that capital was the key to human development and progress. He believed that private property and capital were essential elements of civilized life, and that their efficient use would lead to economic expansion and benefit all members of society.
*   **Labor and Wages**: Sumner's views on labor were shaped by his social darwinist ideology. He argued that the critical factor determining wages was supply and demand in the labor market, and that self-interested workers would limit their number of progeny to acquire capital.

#### C. Implications for Government and Society

Social Darwinism had significant implications for the role of government in society. Sumner believed that the state should be radically demystified, and that its primary concerns were life, liberty, and property. He argued that the defense of property was essential for individuals to pursue happiness, but that this pursuit was a personal responsibility, not one that could be ensured by the state.

#### D. Legacy and Impact

Social Darwinism represented a significant shift in thought, applying Darwinian principles to human society and justifying laissez-faire capitalism and the concentration of wealth among industrialists. Its influence can still be seen today, particularly in its emphasis on individual liberty and the pursuit of happiness as personal responsibilities rather than collective goals.

*   **The Concept of Liberty**: Social Darwinism emphasizes that only individuals have rights, not groups or institutions. A system of liberty aims to restrain all classes from infringing on others' rights, ultimately promoting a balance between individual freedoms and collective well-being.
*   **The Danger of Plutocracy**: The concept of plutocracy, where the wealthy dominate the state, is particularly concerning in modern democracies like the United States. To counter this threat, institutions and guarantees must be established to hold power accountable, with a powerful independent judiciary being a key solution.

#### E. Critique of Social Reformers

Social Darwinism critiques state-led reforms, arguing that true improvements come from technological advancements, not direct efforts. Its legacy includes rejecting traditional Christian ideas of social hierarchy, embodying classical liberal critiques of state power, and promoting a profoundly optimistic view of human progress through individual liberty and initiative.

*   **The "Forgotten Man"**: The concept of the "forgotten man" highlights how state-led reforms redistribute wealth, always at the expense of the industrious worker. Social Darwinism argues that true improvements come from technological advancements, not direct efforts.
*   **Rejection of Traditional Christian Ideas**: Social Darwinism rejects traditional Christian ideas of social hierarchy, instead viewing humans as part of nature, subject to the same laws and struggles as other species.

#### F. Conclusion

Social Darwinism was a revolutionary ideology that emerged in the 19th century, applying Charles Darwin's principles of natural selection to human society. Its influence can still be seen today, particularly in its emphasis on individual liberty and the pursuit of happiness as personal responsibilities rather than collective goals.
