### I. Introduction to Immanuel Kant's Philosophy
#### A. Overview of Kant's Moral Philosophy

Immanuel Kant's philosophical system is a culmination of Enlightenment thought, synthesizing trends from continental rationalism and British empiricism. His moral philosophy reacts against the skeptical, reductive naturalistic approach characteristic of David Hume. Hume's view that morally praiseworthy actions are those agreeable to ourselves or others, useful to ourselves or others, is attractive but problematic, as it tends to subjectivize ethics and make morality a question of opinion or taste.

#### B. Key Features of Kant's Moral Philosophy

- **Universalism**: Kant sought to create a universal system of moral judgment that would be binding on all rational beings under all circumstances.
- **Objectivism**: He aimed to reconcile his Christian faith with the intellectual state of Western culture, formulating a moral philosophy that was intellectually serious and sophisticated.

#### C. The Categorical Imperative

Kant's book, _The Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals_, presents his attempt to establish a universal moral law, which he calls the categorical imperative. This imperative is not based on hypothetical imperatives, such as "if you want x, then do y," but rather on a principle that all rational agents have an obligation to act in accordance with a maxim that could be willed as a universal law of nature.

### II. The Categorical Imperative and Moral Agency
#### A. Understanding the Categorical Imperative

The categorical imperative is a moral principle that demands universal moral duty, applicable not only to individuals but also to nations and collective subjects. This idea is central to Kant's political theory, which emphasizes the creation of a social contract and the elimination of the state of nature between nations.

#### B. The Role of Reason in Moral Agency

Kant argues that when we recognize the universality of moral rules and yet make exceptions for ourselves, we are behaving irrationally and heteronomously. In contrast, when we behave rationally and autonomously, following the categorical imperative, we are being virtuous and living up to the moral rules that apply to everyone.

#### C. The Development of Reason and Moral Agency

Kant's law demands universal moral duty, achieved through the development of reason and the ability to make rational choices. This distinguishes humans from animals governed by heteronomy, emphasizing the potential for humans to become free rational moral agents.

### III. Kant's Philosophy in Context
#### A. Critique of Humean Empiricism

Kant's system is based on rationalism and the notion that moral knowledge and facts are independent of subjective feelings or opinions. This contrasts with David Hume's empiricist approach, which tends to subjectivize ethics and make morality a question of opinion or taste.

#### B. Influence on Western Thought

Kant's ideas about morality and politics have had significant influence on Western thought, shaping the development of human history and informing the concept of a league of nations. His theory has been influential in shaping Western culture and values, with many people implicitly adopting Kantian principles when teaching children about morality and right behavior.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Legacy of Kant's Philosophy

Despite criticisms of its rigor and lifelessness, Kant's philosophy remains a profound and insightful contribution to the moral theory of the Enlightenment. His ideas continue to shape our understanding of human nature and the importance of universal moral rules.
