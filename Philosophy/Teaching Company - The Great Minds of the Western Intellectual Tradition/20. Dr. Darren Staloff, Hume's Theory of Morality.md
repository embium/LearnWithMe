### I. Introduction to Hume's Moral Theory
#### A. Overview of Hume's Contribution

Hume's moral theory, presented in his book "An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals," marks a significant transitional phase between the Scottish School of Moral Sense and Utilitarianism. By drawing on both schools, Hume becomes a seminal creator of the latter. His theory can be seen as a precursor to Nietzsche's genealogical interpretation of morality, with the primary difference being their judgment about it.

#### B. Key Features of Hume's Theory

- **Descriptive Moral Theory**: Unlike traditional moral theories that prescribe duties and virtues, Hume offers a descriptive moral theory, which is a scientific question about morality.
- **Focus on Moral Judgment**: He argues that we already know what we should do through our moral judgments, and the interesting question is how we learn to make such judgments.

### II. The Cause of Moral Judgment
#### A. Sentiment as the Basis of Moral Judgments

Hume's interest lies in describing the cause of moral judgment and evaluation among humans, showing what judgments consist of rather than prescribing a foundational moral theory. He argues that our moral judgments find their origin in a sentiment, specifically a sentiment of approbation or approval, which is a calm passion unlike other passions like anger or fear.

#### B. Arguments Supporting Sentiment as the Basis

- **Precedence of Sentiment**: Hume notes that all our moral judgments are preceded by a sentiment of approbation.
- **Role of Reason**: He argues that reason doesn't really enter into it, and that children, simpletons, and common people can distinguish right from wrong without rational proof.

### III. The Property Common Among Virtues
#### A. Utility as the Instinctual Prompt

Hume's attempt to answer the question scientifically takes the form of identifying the property in common among virtues that might instinctually prompt us to feel approval or disapproval. He finds this element to be utility or usefulness, which conduces to the good of the community or the happiness of the largest number of people.

#### B. Examples and Illustrations

- **Justice Based on Utility**: Hume argues that justice is based on utility and that its existence depends on the need for it.
- **Societies with Super Abundance or Scarcity**: He uses various examples to illustrate this point, including societies where justice would not be useful.

### IV. The Role of Government and International Law
#### A. Utility as the Basis for Social Institutions

Hume argues that government and political society exist solely because they are useful. He also suggests that international law arises only when there is a need for it, such as in the case of international commerce.

#### B. Implications for Moral Progress

- **Learning to Think of Others**: Hume suggests that moral progress comes when we learn to think of others as ourselves, which can be achieved through literature and poetry.
- **Government's Role in Promoting Justice**: He points out that humans have a tendency to exploit those who are powerless, such as women and indigenous peoples.

### V. Aesthetic Considerations
#### A. Utility Excites Sentiments of Approval

Hume turns to aesthetic considerations, arguing that utility excites our sentiments of approval because we have an instinctual disposition to approve of what is useful. He suggests that this disposition is cultivated through reading fine fiction, seeing good movies, and learning about other cultures.

#### B. Implications for Virtue and Morality

- **Virtue as Its Own Reward**: Hume's view sparks a reaction from Kant, who finds it despicable, but also serves as a rejoinder to Hume's Calvinist background.
- **Cultivation of Moral Behavior**: The notion that virtuous behavior is not an onerous duty, but rather the best part of life, is a compelling idea.

### VI. Conclusion
#### A. Implications for Morality and Ethics

Hume's moral theory has significant implications for how we evaluate policies and leaders, prioritizing results over intentions. The idea that morality is an instinctual response raises questions about our expectations and values. While some may see this as a bleak view of human nature, others can find satisfaction in the simple pleasure of helping others and promoting the well-being of all people.

#### B. Choice Between Perspectives

Ultimately, the choice between these perspectives remains a vital one for us all.
