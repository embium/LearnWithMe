### I. Introduction to Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophy
#### A. Early Work: Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

Ludwig Wittgenstein's early work, the Tractatus logico-philosophicus, was a seminal text in the positivist tradition. This young philosopher's elegant and decisive skepticism regarding logic and thought is evident throughout the book, which consists of 70 pages elaborating on seven sentences. The Tractatus presents a theory of declarative sentences, outlining what can be expressed clearly or not at all.

#### B. Key Features of the Tractatus

- **The World as Fact**: Wittgenstein's first sentence, "The world is all that is the case," sets the tone for his strictly one-world interpretation of thought and language.
- **Logical Implications**: He then proceeds to elaborate on each sentence, working out logical implications and attempting to be logically exhaustive in his analysis.
- **Limits of Language**: The last sentence of the Tractatus, "What we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence," marks a significant shift towards skepticism, where only what can be expressed clearly is taken seriously as philosophical propositions.

#### C. Reception and Critique

Wittgenstein's work was met with great acclaim among philosophers, but he soon became uneasy with his own certainty and began to question the limits of language and thought. This led him to re-evaluate his earlier ideas and develop a new perspective on philosophy.

### II. Later Work: Philosophical Investigations
#### A. Shift in Intellectual Orientation

Wittgenstein's later work, the Philosophical Investigations, marked a profound change in intellectual orientation, treating language not as a picture of reality, but as a game or set of social practices that overlap and have no single unifying characteristic.

#### B. Language Games and Definition by Example

- **Challenging Traditional Notions**: Wittgenstein's ideas on language games and definition by example challenged traditional notions of philosophical inquiry, emphasizing practical contingency over logical necessity.
- **Practical Use of Language**: His work continues to be influential today, offering a nuanced understanding of how words actually work in the practical empirical world.

### III. Implications for Philosophy
#### A. The Concept of "Chair"

The concept of a "chair" raises questions about the nature of language, logic, and understanding. Plato would argue for absolute logical precision, but this demand can be impossible to meet, leading to ambiguity and uncertainty.

#### B. Fuzzy Photographs and Family Resemblance

- **Imperfect Definitions**: The idea of a "fuzzy photograph" illustrates how our definitions can be imperfect, yet still useful for certain purposes.
- **Family Resemblance**: This perspective suggests that we should focus on the practical use of language rather than seeking ultimate certainty or essential definitions. In philosophy, this approach is known as "family resemblance," where concepts like "chair" are defined by their shared characteristics and similarities, rather than a single, precise definition.

#### C. Observable Behavior and Conceptual Misapprehensions

- **Understanding Concepts**: This view also implies that understanding a concept is not solely based on mental experiences, but rather on observable behavior.
- **Philosopher's Goal**: The philosopher's goal is to help us improve our thinking and overcome conceptual misapprehensions, acknowledging the incompleteness of language games and the impossibility of finding a universal skeleton key.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Embracing Ambiguity

Ultimately, this perspective rescues us from unnecessary worry and frustration by embracing the ambiguity and fuzziness of human discourse, allowing us to communicate effectively and find meaning in our shared experiences.
