### I. Edmund Husserl: A Foundational Philosopher
#### A. Background and Influences

Edmund Husserl was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. His philosophical approach was deeply rooted in a Platonic tradition, emphasizing the importance of universal and abstract concepts. Husserl's early background in mathematics significantly influenced his philosophical method, which sought to construct a new foundation for knowledge through phenomenology.

#### B. Phenomenological Method

Husserl's phenomenological method involves suspending the external world and examining the internal contents of human experience. This approach aims to discern essential and permanent qualities that are common to all humans. By doing so, Husserl sought to derive a priori statements about what it means to be a human being, striving for absolute certainty without presuppositions.

#### C. Criticisms and Challenges

Despite its ambition, Husserl's project has been criticized for its difficulty in execution. Some argue that his method relies on an unproven assumption that the self can be known through introspection. Additionally, the problem of truth conditions arises, as it becomes unclear how to distinguish between essential and contingent properties.

#### D. Influence on Continental Philosophy

Husserl's ideas have had a significant influence on continental philosophy, particularly in the development of phenomenology and existentialism. His philosophical project involves attempting to bridge the gap between internal experiences and external reality, but this endeavor is fraught with difficulties. The method of phenomenology faces challenges in establishing a universal logical procedure for determining essential predicates of human experience.

#### E. Critique by Wittgenstein

Wittgenstein's critique argues that essences are actually tied to language use rather than any inherent quality of the mind. This challenge highlights the complexity of Husserl's ideas and the difficulties in establishing a clear understanding of human cognition.

#### F. The Life-World and Internal Reality

Husserl's later work on the life-world attempts to address this issue by considering human experience as it appears to individuals. However, his ideas remain nebulous and difficult to communicate. This approach also faces challenges, particularly in establishing intersubjectivity and bridging the gap between individual experiences.

#### G. Continental Philosophy and Internal Experience

The continental response to the Anglo-American tradition's emphasis on precision is to sacrifice some clarity in order to enlarge the domain of discourse and include internal reality. However, this approach also highlights the importance of considering internal experience and the need for a more nuanced understanding of human cognition.

### II. The Problem of Theory Preceding Experience
#### A. The Issue with Anglo-American Philosophy

Western philosophy has drifted into a problem where theory precedes experience, with many thinkers starting from the assumption that their own experiences are mistaken. This approach is fundamentally flawed, as it puts the cart before the horse.

#### B. Continental Philosophy and Internal Examination

The tradition of continental philosophy in the 20th century, which includes Husserl, Heidegger, and Bergson, among others, shares this issue. These philosophers often begin by examining themselves, but their theories can become nebulous and fuzzy. This is not a weakness, but rather a built-in problem that arises from prioritizing precision over range.

#### C. The Importance of Loosening One's Diction

In philosophy, hitting the high notes - discussing right and wrong, beauty, and the human experience - requires a willingness to loosen one's diction and sacrifice some precision for greater depth and understanding.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. Husserl's Legacy

Despite its flaws, Husserl's phenomenology is a serious attempt to account for what it means to be an ego in the 20th century, offering valuable insights into the nature of subjective experience. His ideas have had a lasting impact on continental philosophy and continue to influence philosophical thought today.

#### B. The Significance of Internal Experience

The importance of considering internal experience and the need for a more nuanced understanding of human cognition are key takeaways from Husserl's work. This approach highlights the complexity of human experience and the challenges in establishing a clear understanding of subjective reality.
