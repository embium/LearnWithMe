### I. The Motivation Behind Moral Behavior
#### A. Philosophical Perspectives on Morality

The concept of morality has been debated by philosophers for centuries, with Plato's Republic being a seminal work in this discussion. In the dialogue, Glaucon argues that people act justly only because they want to seem just, not because they genuinely value justice. This idea is contrasted with Socrates' view that true persuasion requires acting justly, not just appearing to do so.

Glaucon uses two stories to illustrate his point: the ring of Gyges and the inversion. The ring of Gyges allows its wearer to act immorally without being detected, yet still gain a good reputation. This suggests that people are more concerned with appearances than actual moral behavior. In contrast, the story of the inversion shows how someone who acts justly can be perceived as acting unjustly, and vice versa.

These philosophical perspectives on morality highlight the tension between appearing moral and actually being so. They raise important questions about what motivates people to act morally and whether it's more important to appear moral or genuinely value justice.

#### B. Empirical Research on Moral Integrity and Hypocrisy

Contemporary research has also explored this topic, with studies showing that people tend to rate themselves highly for behaving morally even when they've taken advantage of ambiguous situations. However, when subjects were placed in front of a mirror while making their decisions, the percentage of those who assigned themselves to the positive condition decreased significantly.

This suggests that people are more concerned with appearing moral to themselves than actually acting fairly. A study in England found that people are more likely to behave prosocially when they feel observed, even if it's just by themselves. In this study, a cup for coffee machine donations was placed in a department with either flowers or pairs of eyes taped above it.

When the eyes were present, nearly everyone donated money, but when there were only flowers, almost no one did. This demonstrates that people are inclined to behave morally when they feel observed and can be leveraged to promote prosocial behavior.

#### C. The Role of Observation in Promoting Moral Behavior

Research has shown that even a simple act like putting a pair of eyes on your computer or a mirror behind your desk can encourage you to complete tasks without procrastinating. This idea is echoed in Plato's Republic, where the story of Gyges' ring of invisibility highlights the tendency for people to behave immorally when they feel unobserved.

The question remains how society can be structured to promote moral behavior and provide stability that allows human beings to flourish. By understanding what motivates people to act morally and whether it's more important to appear moral or genuinely value justice, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society.

### II. The Impact of Observation on Moral Behavior
#### A. The Power of Observation in Promoting Prosocial Behavior

Studies have shown that people are more likely to behave prosocially when they feel observed, even if it's just by themselves. This suggests that the presence of an observer can be a powerful motivator for moral behavior.

#### B. The Role of Self-Observation in Promoting Moral Behavior

Research has also shown that self-observation can play a significant role in promoting moral behavior. When subjects were placed in front of a mirror while making their decisions, the percentage of those who assigned themselves to the positive condition decreased significantly.

This suggests that people are more concerned with appearing moral to themselves than actually acting fairly. However, this does not mean that self-observation is always negative. In fact, research has shown that even a simple act like putting a pair of eyes on your computer or a mirror behind your desk can encourage you to complete tasks without procrastinating.

### III. Conclusion
The motivation behind moral behavior is complex and multifaceted. Philosophical perspectives on morality highlight the tension between appearing moral and actually being so, while empirical research shows that people are more likely to behave prosocially when they feel observed.

By understanding what motivates people to act morally and whether it's more important to appear moral or genuinely value justice, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society. The role of observation in promoting moral behavior is a crucial aspect of this discussion, and further research is needed to fully understand its impact.
