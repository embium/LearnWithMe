### I. The Trolley Problem and Moral Dilemmas
#### A. Overview of the Trolley Problem Variants

The trolley problem has been a cornerstone in discussions on moral dilemmas, with various philosophers presenting different perspectives on this classic thought experiment. The apparent asymmetry in responses to the bystander case and the fat man case is a recurring theme, with some arguing that there is no asymmetry when considering additional hypothetical cases.

#### B. Philosophers' Perspectives

- **Judy Thomson's Argument**: Thomson suggests that there is no asymmetry when considering an additional hypothetical case where one is standing on a third track. This perspective challenges the idea that responses to the bystander and fat man cases are fundamentally different.
  
- **Josh Greene's Perspective**: Greene proposes that the emotional part of our brain response mechanism is activated by the up-close nature of the fat man case, leading to differential responses. This suggests that emotional factors play a significant role in shaping our moral decisions.

- **Cass Sunstein's Argument**: Sunstein argues that though responses differ, the cases are the same deep down. He emphasizes the use of heuristics in moral reasoning, where features that should be morally irrelevant can influence our decisions.

#### C. The Role of Heuristics in Moral Reasoning

Sunstein's analysis focuses on the use of heuristics in moral reasoning, where features that should be morally irrelevant can influence our decisions. He cites examples from Jonathan Haidt's work, such as consensual incest between siblings and cleaning a bathroom floor with the American flag, where people express moral disapproval without being able to articulate what rule is violated.

- **Heuristics vs. Target Attributes**: Sunstein suggests that we often focus on heuristics rather than target attributes in moral reasoning. This phenomenon can lead us to make mistakes in what sorts of behaviors we permit.

#### D. Implications for Mill and Kant's Theories

The discussion touches on the implications of these ideas for Mill and Kant's theories on morality. Mill argues that moral reasoning is a branch of reason, not of sensitive faculty, and that our moral beliefs are due to the tacit influence of reflectively available standards.

- **Mill's View**: Mill suggests that attempting to derive morality from examples is worse service than can be rendered to morality.

Kant proposes that attempting to derive morality from examples is worse service than can be rendered to morality. This highlights the tension between using heuristics and focusing on target attributes in moral reasoning.

### II. Moral Luck and Responsibility
#### A. Introduction to Moral Luck

The concept of moral luck arises when an agent's actions or consequences are influenced by factors beyond their control, leading to varying degrees of moral praise and blame.

- **Moral Luck**: This phenomenon is illustrated through examples such as Lucky Alert and Unlucky Alert, who perform the same actions but with different outcomes, resulting in 5% and 19% of respondents respectively considering one morally blameworthy.

#### B. The Control Principle vs. Moral Luck

The control principle suggests that moral praise and blame should not be assigned when the action or consequences lie beyond the agent's control. In contrast, the moral luck principle proposes that even with factors outside of one's control, moral evaluation is still possible.

- **Competing Commitments**: These principles are difficult to reconcile, as they rely on competing commitments regarding agency and responsibility.

#### C. The Problem of Moral Luck

The problem of moral luck has no clear solution, with some arguing that luck plays a role in moral evaluation, while others suggest that we never truly know an individual's level of responsibility until the consequences of their actions are revealed.

- **Uncertainty about Agency**: Ultimately, this leaves us with a perplexing non-solution to a profound moral problem, where the language of praise and blame is essential but difficult to maintain in the face of uncertainty about agency and responsibility.
