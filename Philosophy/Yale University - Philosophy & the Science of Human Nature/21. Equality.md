### I. The Social Contract in the Context of Cooperation
#### A. Introduction to the Concept of Cooperation and Its Implications

The discussion around cooperation has shifted from examining its benefits for societal structures to considering how a larger community should be structured if cooperation is beneficial but requires incentivizing. This contemporary version of the social contract question asks what principles should guide the distribution of goods and responsibilities across a community, taking into account the idea that cooperation is beneficial but competition isn't.

#### B. The Role of John Rawls in Contemporary Philosophical Discussion

The 20th-century philosopher John Rawls' discussion in his influential book "A Theory of Justice" brought back into contemporary philosophical discussion consideration of questions about why people's self-interest would lead them to participate in a societal structure. Rawls begins by saying that society is a more or less self-sufficient association of persons who recognize certain rules of conduct as binding and act in accordance with them, designed to advance the good of those taking part.

#### C. The Concept of Conflict and Identity of Interests

Societies are typically marked by conflict as well as identity of interests due to differences in how benefits from cooperation are distributed. Rawls points out that a set of principles is required for choosing among various social arrangements, which determine this distribution of advantages. These principles provide a way of assigning rights and duties in the basic institutions of society, defining an appropriate distribution of benefits and burdens of social cooperation.

#### D. The Veil of Ignorance: A Thought Experiment

The main idea of "A Theory of Justice" is that the principles articulating the legitimate structure of society are those to which you would agree if you did not know which person you were going to be. This is achieved through the concept of the veil of ignorance, where individuals behind this veil determine what they would accept as fair and just for all members of society. Rawls' strategy involves imagining a scenario where people choose between different social arrangements without knowing their own position in society, leading them to prioritize fairness and justice over personal gain.

#### E. Principles of Justice Derived from the Veil of Ignorance

In Rawls' thought experiment, individuals behind a "veil of ignorance" would choose a society where basic liberties and fair equality of opportunity are guaranteed, regardless of their circumstances. This includes access to education and job opportunities that are not dependent on family financial resources. Additionally, inequalities in income or resources would be accepted only if they benefit the least well off.

#### F. Prioritizing Fairness Over Overall Utility

Rawls argues that these principles should take precedence over considerations of overall utility, meaning that freedoms cannot be traded for greater economic benefits. In a hypothetical scenario where individuals must choose between societies with varying levels of income and civil rights, most people would prefer a society with lower average income but equal access to basic rights and opportunities. This suggests that many people prioritize fairness and equality over economic gain.

#### G. Conclusion

The discussion around cooperation and its implications for societal structures highlights the need for principles that guide the distribution of goods and responsibilities across a community. Rawls' concept of the veil of ignorance provides a thought-provoking approach to deriving these principles, emphasizing the importance of fairness and justice in societal arrangements.
