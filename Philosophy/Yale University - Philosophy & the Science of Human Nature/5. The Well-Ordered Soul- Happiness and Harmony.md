### I. Self-Regulation and Commitment Strategies
#### A. The Power of External Constraints

The professor's case study on student internet use during class demonstrated the effectiveness of external constraints in maintaining commitments. When students were asked to commit to turning off their internet completely, a quarter restricted their usage, and only a small percentage had no restriction. This experiment highlighted the importance of external factors in shaping behavior.

External constraints can be particularly useful in promoting self-regulation, as they provide an objective measure of accountability. In this context, the professor's use of "computer condoms" and smiley face stickers served as social reinforcements for students who committed to not using the internet during class. These visual reminders helped students stay on track and maintain their commitments.

#### B. The Concept of Computer Condoms

The term "computer condom" refers to a device or software that restricts access to certain websites or online activities, promoting responsible behavior in the digital age. This concept is particularly relevant in educational settings, where students may be tempted to engage in distracting online behaviors during class.

By using computer condoms, educators can create a more focused and productive learning environment, while also teaching students essential skills for self-regulation and time management.

#### C. The Role of Social Reinforcement

Social reinforcement, such as smiley face stickers or public recognition, can be an effective way to motivate students to maintain their commitments. By acknowledging and rewarding responsible behavior, educators can create a positive feedback loop that encourages students to continue making good choices.

In the context of the professor's experiment, the use of smiley face stickers served as a visual reminder of student commitment, while also providing a sense of accomplishment and pride in responsible behavior.

### II. Plato's Republic and the Concept of Justice
#### A. The Intrinsic Value of Justice

Plato's Republic explores the concept of justice, arguing that it has both intrinsic and instrumental value. According to Socrates, justice is a kind of health for the soul, just as physical health is for the body.

This idea suggests that justice is not merely a means to an end but rather an essential aspect of human flourishing. By cultivating justice within ourselves, we can achieve a deeper sense of well-being and fulfillment.

#### B. The Instrumental Value of Justice

In addition to its intrinsic value, Plato argues that justice also has instrumental value. This means that justice is not only good in itself but also serves as a means to other desirable outcomes, such as happiness and prosperity.

By promoting justice within society, we can create a more stable and harmonious community, where individuals can thrive and reach their full potential.

### III. Jonathan Haidt's Discussion on Happiness
#### A. The Limits of Material Wealth

Jonathan Haidt's discussion in chapter five of his book challenges the common notion that happiness is directly tied to material wealth and physical goods. According to Haidt, this idea is partially true but incomplete, as human flourishing comes from reflection and wisdom rather than mere possessions.

This concept is rooted in psychological principles that govern human perception and judgment, making us sensitive to contrast and poor at absolute judgments. As a result, we often find ourselves constantly seeking new experiences and possessions to maintain the same level of satisfaction.

#### B. The Importance of Reflection and Wisdom

Haidt's discussion highlights the importance of reflection and wisdom in achieving happiness and fulfillment. By cultivating these qualities within ourselves, we can develop a deeper understanding of what truly brings us joy and satisfaction.

This idea is closely tied to Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, or human flourishing, which will be explored further in the next lecture.

### IV. Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics
#### A. The Concept of Eudaimonia

Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics explores the concept of eudaimonia, or human flourishing, as the highest good for humans. According to Aristotle, happiness is achieved by doing what is best and most completely human, which involves reasoning and acting in accordance with virtue.

This idea suggests that human flourishing is not solely dependent on external factors but rather requires a deep understanding of our own values and principles.

#### B. The Role of Reasoning and Virtue

Aristotle argues that reason is the special function of human beings, allowing us to perform our unique human task especially well when we reason well. By cultivating virtue and reasoning skills, we can achieve a deeper sense of fulfillment and happiness.

This concept will be further explored in the next lecture, where we will examine the virtues that make us distinctly and most excellently human and how they are cultivated.
