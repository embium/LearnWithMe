### I. Introduction to the Trolley Problem
#### A. Overview of the Classic Trolley Problem

The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment in ethics, first introduced by philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967. It presents a dilemma where a bystander must decide whether to divert a runaway trolley from killing five people to killing one person instead. This scenario has been widely used to explore the nature of moral decision-making and the principles that guide our choices.

#### B. Variants of the Trolley Problem

The classic trolley problem has been modified in various ways to test different aspects of human morality. Two notable variants are:

*   **Fat Man**: In this version, the bystander can stop the trolley by pushing a fat man off a bridge onto the track, killing him and saving the five people.
*   **Bystander's Three Options**: This scenario presents three options for Jim: allowing the trolley to hit five people, deflecting it to hit another person, or deflecting it to hit himself.

### II. Alternative Methodologies for Making Moral Decisions
#### A. Judy Thomson's Rethinking of the Cases

Judy Thomson has reevaluated the classic trolley problem and its variants, arguing that our moral intuitions may not be the best basis for building moral theories. She suggests that we should consider alternative methodologies for making moral decisions.

#### B. Josh Greene's View on Moral Decision-Making

Josh Greene proposes that our responses to moral dilemmas are often driven by emotional processing rather than rational calculation. He argues that when we consider cases like Fat Man, our emotional system is activated, whereas in cases like Bystander, our rational system is activated.

#### C. Cass Sunstein's Suggestion on the Trolley Problem

Cass Sunstein suggests that the classic trolley problem and its variants are fundamentally the same, and that our moral responses to these scenarios should be guided by a consistent methodology.

### III. The Role of Emotional Processing in Moral Decision-Making
#### A. Greene's Argument for Rational System Dominance

Greene argues that since the morally right thing to do is determined by the outputs of our rational system, we should trust the rational system. He suggests that emotional processing can lead to errors in moral decision-making.

#### B. Neuroimaging Studies Supporting Greene's Argument

Neuroimaging studies have shown that brain areas associated with emotion are activated in moral/personal cases like Fat Man, whereas brain areas associated with working memory are more active in impersonal and non-moral cases like Bystander. This evidence supports Greene's argument that our emotional system can drive our moral responses.

### IV. The Complexity of Moral Decision-Making
#### A. Multiple Perspectives on the Trolley Problem

The discussion surrounding the trolley problem highlights the complexities of moral decision-making. Different perspectives and methodologies are necessary to approach these dilemmas, and our moral intuitions may not be the best basis for building moral theories.

#### B. The Influence of Emotional Processing on Moral Decisions

Research has shown that emotional processing can influence our judgments about punishment and wrongdoing. Feelings of disgust can also impact our responses to moral dilemmas. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that people's responses to moral dilemmas can be manipulated by varying seemingly irrelevant features.

#### C. Heuristics in Moral Decision-Making

Our moral reasoning may rely on heuristics, which are fast and frugal tools for navigating complex situations. However, these heuristics can lead to errors in both non-moral and moral cases. Sunstein argues that people often use heuristics in making moral judgments, potentially leading to mistakes.

### V. Conclusion
The trolley problem and its variants have been used to explore the nature of moral decision-making and the principles that guide our choices. Different perspectives and methodologies are necessary to approach these dilemmas, and our moral intuitions may not be the best basis for building moral theories. The complexity of moral decision-making is highlighted by the influence of emotional processing on our judgments and the reliance on heuristics in making moral decisions.
