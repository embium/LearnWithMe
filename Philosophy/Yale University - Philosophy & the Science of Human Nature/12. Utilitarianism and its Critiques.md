### I. Introduction to Moral Theories in the Western Tradition
#### A. Overview of Moral Philosophy

Moral philosophy systematically endeavors to understand moral concepts and justify moral principles and theories. It aims to provide accounts of terms like "right" and "wrong," and provide an answer to the question of whether a particular act is morally OK. A moral theory also seeks to tell us why we gave the answers that we did in this question, by identifying a common feature among acts that fall into the category of moral versus immoral.

Moral theories aim to provide answers to three main questions: 
1. **Moral motivation**: Why would we want to act morally?
2. **Particularism**: What should we do insofar as we seek to act morally?
3. **Universalism**: Whether a particular act is morally OK?

These questions also encompass broader concerns, such as our duties to those who are less fortunate, like helping the environment or respecting elders.

#### B. Key Questions and Concerns

- **Moral motivation**: What drives us to act morally? Is it self-interest, empathy, or something else?
- **Particularism**: How do we decide what actions are morally right in specific situations?
- **Universalism**: Can we establish a universal moral principle that applies across all cultures and contexts?

### II. Major Moral Theories in the Western Tradition
#### A. Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism tells us that an act is moral if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number. This theory focuses on the consequences of actions rather than their inherent nature.

- **Key concept**: The greatest happiness principle, formulated by John Stuart Mill.
- **Definition**: Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to promote the reverse of happiness.

#### B. Deontology

Deontology focuses on the act itself rather than its consequences. This theory emphasizes the importance of rules and duties over individual happiness or utility.

- **Key concept**: The moral rule that an action is right if it conforms to a moral law or principle.
- **Definition**: Actions are morally justifiable based on their adherence to a set of universal principles, regardless of their consequences.

#### C. Virtue Ethics

Virtue ethics looks at the actor's character rather than the act itself. This theory emphasizes the importance of developing good character traits and virtues in making moral decisions.

- **Key concept**: The idea that moral behavior is a result of having good character.
- **Definition**: Actions are morally justifiable based on the character and intentions of the individual performing them.

#### D. Religious Ethics

Religious ethics appeals to divine mandate, emphasizing the importance of following religious teachings and principles in making moral decisions.

- **Key concept**: The idea that morality is derived from a higher power or divine authority.
- **Definition**: Actions are morally justifiable based on their alignment with religious teachings and principles.

### III. Empirical Research and Case Studies
#### A. John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism

John Stuart Mill's formulation of the greatest happiness principle suggests that actions should be guided by the principle of maximizing overall happiness or utility. A thought experiment was conducted to test this idea, where participants were asked to choose between two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: Receiving a significant amount of happiness while others received little.
- **Scenario 2**: Sacrificing some of their own happiness to benefit many others.

The results showed that most people initially prioritized their own happiness but shifted towards valuing the greater good as the scenarios progressed. However, when faced with a situation where someone else's suffering was necessary for the greater good, participants became more divided, and some even rejected the idea that morality demands sacrifices.

#### B. The Omelas Story

The Omelas story presents a society where the happiness of its members depends on the suffering of one child. This raises questions about whether this structure is morally acceptable and whether recognizing the comfort brought by someone else's suffering can be a form of rationalization or a genuine moral awareness.

This thought-provoking scenario encourages participants to ponder the complexities of morality and the importance of considering the impact of their actions on others.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Points

- **Moral theories**: Utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and religious ethics are four major moral theories in the Western tradition.
- **Key concepts**:
  - Greatest happiness principle (utilitarianism)
  - Moral rule or principle (deontology)
  - Good character (virtue ethics)
  - Divine mandate (religious ethics)

#### B. Reflection and Discussion

This lecture aims to introduce key moral theories and encourage participants to reflect on the complexities of morality. The thought experiment and case studies presented provide a starting point for discussion and exploration of these ideas.

By examining different perspectives and considering the impact of our actions, we can develop a deeper understanding of what it means to act morally and make informed decisions in various contexts.
