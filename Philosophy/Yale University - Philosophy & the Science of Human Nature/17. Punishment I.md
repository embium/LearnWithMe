### I. Introduction to Moral Responsibility and Interpersonal Relations
#### A. Overview of the Course Progression

The course has progressed from considering human beings as individuals achieving harmony within themselves (the first part) to morality and interpersonal relations (the second part), and will now explore how political structures cultivate certain behaviors in individuals (the third part). This section focuses on the transition between the morality section and the political philosophy section, specifically examining punishment as a transitional unit.

#### B. Case Studies: The Trolley Problem and Nuclear Power Plant Disaster

The professor presents two case studies to encourage students to think critically about moral responsibility:

*   **Trolley Problem:** Students are asked if it would be morally mandatory, permitted but not mandatory, or prohibited to redirect radioactive clouds from 13 million people to a smaller area. The results show that 31% responded that it's morally mandatory and 56% saying it's morally permitted.
*   **Conscripting Workers:** Students are asked if it would be morally mandatory, permitted but not mandatory, or prohibited to conscript workers to save lives by sacrificing a small number of individuals. The results show that 32% responded that it's morally prohibited and 41% saying it's morally permitted.

The professor encourages students to think about why their responses differ from those in hypothetical cases.

### II. Punishment: A Transitional Unit
#### A. Definition and Characteristics of Civil Punishment

Civil punishment is characterized as involving unpleasantness or suffering, being inflicted in response to an offense, being intentionally administered by a human agent, and being imposed by a legal authority with the sanction of the state behind it.

#### B. Justifications for Punishment: Forward-Looking and Retributive

Two justifications for punishment are presented:

*   **Forward-Looking Justification:** Sees punishment as an effective mechanism for avoiding future harm.
*   **Retributive Justification:** Holds that punishment is called for because the individual has violated moral or legal codes and deserves to be penalized.

#### C. Alternative Ways of Thinking about Punishment: Restitution, Rehabilitation, and Justice

The professor discusses restitution, rehabilitation, and justice as alternative ways of thinking about punishment, using the example of Gyges' horse being stolen by Pedro.

### III. Retributivist Outlook
#### A. Immanuel Kant's View on Punishment

The retributivist outlook sees punishment as a means of reorienting the scales of justice and visiting desert upon the harm-doer, citing Immanuel Kant's work on this topic. According to Kant, the undeserved evil committed by one person should be regarded as perpetrated on themselves.

#### B. Robert Nozick's Analysis: Retribution vs. Revenge

Robert Nozick's analysis differentiates between retribution and revenge by highlighting their distinct triggers, limits, and emotional tones. Retribution is impersonal, carried out by the state, and seeks justice without personal satisfaction, whereas revenge is personal, unlimited, and driven by a desire for vengeance.

#### C. Perplexing Situations: "Justice as the World Ends"

The knowledge condition in both retribution and revenge involves the target being aware of why they are being punished or avenged. This distinction gives rise to perplexing situations, such as the phenomenon of "justice as the world ends," where measures are taken to restore a condemned person's health so that they can be executed according to their punishment.

#### D. Conclusion: Prioritizing Justice and Moral Desert

Kant's statement that even if society is ending, the last murderer should be executed before it does, serves as a testament to the retributivist picture, which prioritizes justice and moral desert over practical considerations.
