### I. Aristotle's Views on Happiness and Harmony
#### A. The Concept of Virtues of Character

Aristotle believed that virtues of character arise in us neither by nature nor against nature, but rather through habituation. This process involves practicing virtuous actions until they become habitual. He emphasized the importance of finding a balance between excess and deficiency in cultivating these virtues.

**Key Term:** Habituation - The process of developing habits or characteristics through repeated practice or experience.

Aristotle noted that virtues can be ruined by either too much or too little of a particular trait, and that the ideal is to strive for the **Aristotelian Mean**, which represents a balance between excess and deficiency. For example, courage is not about being fearless, but rather about facing danger with confidence and composure.

#### B. The Importance of Balance in Virtue Development

Aristotle's concept of virtues of character highlights the importance of balance in developing these traits. He believed that virtues can be cultivated through habituation, but also warned against the dangers of excess or deficiency. This idea is still relevant today, as we strive to develop positive habits and characteristics.

**Example:** Consider a person who is trying to cultivate patience. If they become too patient, they may become complacent or lack motivation. On the other hand, if they are not patient enough, they may become frustrated or irritable. The ideal is to find a balance between these extremes, cultivating patience without becoming overly passive.

### II. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Habit Formation
#### A. Understanding Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a contemporary articulation of Aristotle's ideas on habit formation. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding how our thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected.

**Key Term:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - A type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.

CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and actions are all connected, and that by changing one aspect, we can influence the others. This approach has been shown to be effective in treating a range of mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression.

#### B. The Role of Habituation in CBT

CBT involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors, which is closely related to Aristotle's concept of habituation. By practicing new, more positive habits and thought patterns, individuals can develop greater self-awareness and control over their emotions and actions.

**Example:** Consider a person who has a tendency to become anxious in social situations. Through CBT, they may learn to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, such as "I'm not good enough" or "Everyone is judging me." By practicing new, more positive habits and thought patterns, such as self-compassion and assertiveness, they can develop greater confidence and self-esteem.

### III. Jonathan Shay's Work on the Experiences of Vietnam Veterans
#### A. The Importance of Moral Order in Maintaining Well-being

Jonathan Shay's work highlights the importance of moral order in maintaining the well-being of soldiers and society at large. His research emphasizes the devastating consequences of war, which extend beyond physical harm to affect survivors' actions, perceptions, and social experiences.

**Key Term:** Moral Order - The set of values and principles that guide human behavior and decision-making.

Shay's work challenges Glaucon's notion that morality is merely a matter of seeming, as soldiers express concern about what they have done, rather than how they are perceived. This issue will be taken up in the next lecture with discussions on Milgram, Epictetus, and contemporary analogues.

#### B. The Phenomenon of PTSD and Its Impact on Individuals and Societies

The phenomenon of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not limited to individuals but can also affect societies as a whole, producing an approximation of post-traumatic stress disorder. Shay's work illustrates this point through examples from the Iliad and Vietnam soldiers' experiences.

**Key Term:** Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - A mental health condition that develops after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.

The consequences of war can be far-reaching, affecting not only individuals but also communities and societies. The loss of trust and recognition that ordinary objects can hold potential danger can lead to a cycle of disorder, as seen in the experiences of Vietnam soldiers and the Iliad's tale of mania and anger.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Concepts

This lecture has explored Aristotle's views on happiness and harmony, the concept of virtues of character, cognitive behavioral therapy, and Jonathan Shay's work on the experiences of Vietnam veterans. The key concepts discussed include:

* Habituation - The process of developing habits or characteristics through repeated practice or experience.
* Virtues of Character - Traits that arise in us neither by nature nor against nature, but rather through habituation.
* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - A type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.
* Moral Order - The set of values and principles that guide human behavior and decision-making.
* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - A mental health condition that develops after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.

#### B. Implications for Everyday Life

The concepts discussed in this lecture have implications for everyday life, as we strive to develop positive habits and characteristics, maintain moral order, and support individuals affected by trauma. By understanding these ideas, we can cultivate greater self-awareness, empathy, and compassion, leading to a more harmonious and fulfilling life.
