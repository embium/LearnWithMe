### I. Liberty and Property Ownership
#### A. Introduction to Nozick's Views on Property Ownership

Nozick presents a framework for thinking about political philosophy that prioritizes liberty and rights, with the legitimacy of property ownership justified by three parts: justice in acquisition, justice in transfer, and rectification. This framework is discussed in chapter seven of Anarchy, State, and Utopia.

#### B. Justice in Acquisition

Nozick's first part concerns the conditions under which it is legitimate to take something from common stock, as long as one leaves "as much and as good" for others, following the Lockean Proviso. This principle emphasizes the importance of respecting the rights of others when acquiring property.

#### C. Justice in Transfer

Nozick's second part concerns justice in transfer, where any transfer between two willing individuals is legitimate. However, this raises questions about the legitimacy of redistributive policies and the role of luck in determining human experience.

#### D. Rectification

Nozick recognizes a need for a third notion: rectification, which involves addressing past injustices, such as the founding of this nation on black slavery. This may require a more extensive state to rectify past wrongs, and Nozick notes that Rawls suggests organizing society to benefit the least well off.

### II. The Debate Between Rawls and Nozick
#### A. Introduction to the Debate

The debate between Rawls and Nozick centers on how to deal with moral luck, with Rawls advocating for principles that nullify accidents of natural endowment and social circumstance, while Nozick emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and responsibility.

#### B. Rawls' View on Moral Luck

Rawls argues that principles should be designed to ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control. He suggests organizing society to benefit the least well off, which would help to mitigate the effects of moral luck.

#### C. Nozick's Response to Rawls

Nozick responds to Rawls' view by emphasizing the importance of individual autonomy and responsibility. He argues that liberty upsets patterns, making it inevitable for some individuals to be better off than others, even if they start with equal resources.

### III. The Role of Social Structures in Shaping Human Attitudes and Behavior
#### A. Introduction to the Article from Behavioral and Brain Sciences

The article from Behavioral and Brain Sciences highlights the vast power of cultural experiences on human perception, categorization, memory, attention, spatial cognition, self-concepts, judgments of fairness, tendencies towards cooperation, conformity, moral judgments, and more.

#### B. The Limitations of WEIRD Subjects in Psychological Research

The article challenges the assumption that psychological research should be based on broader population samples, rather than just WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) subjects. This is because cultural experiences can significantly influence how people perceive the world.

#### C. Examples of Cultural Differences in Perception and Thinking

There are three cases where experience has affected how people perceive the world:

*   A line segment illusion that is perceived differently in Western and non-Western cultures.
*   Research by Nisbett and collaborators found that Japanese individuals were better at recognizing objects when they were presented against a familiar background, whereas Western subjects performed equally well with or without a background.
*   Studies have shown that Americans tend to prioritize individualism and self-reliance over social relationships and community well-being, whereas other Western cultures, such as Germany and Australia, exhibit more nuanced views on these issues.

#### D. The Importance of Considering Cultural Context

These findings are not meant to imply that one culture is superior or inferior to another, but rather to highlight the importance of considering cultural context when making generalizations about human behavior and cognition.
