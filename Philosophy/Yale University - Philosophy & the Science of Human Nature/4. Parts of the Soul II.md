### I. Sampling Bias
#### A. Introduction to Sampling Bias

Sampling bias occurs when the sample collected is not representative of the population it is intended to represent. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions and a distorted view of reality. The concept of sampling bias was illustrated through a polling exercise where students were asked if they had clickers, resulting in 97% responding affirmatively. However, this figure only represented those who already possessed clickers, not the overall percentage of students with clickers.

#### B. Examples of Sampling Bias

*   A study that only surveyed students who handed in their schedules may have skewed results due to freshmen and sophomores being more likely to have done so.
*   The article "The Weirdest People in the World" highlights how psychological research often relies on Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations, which may not be representative of human nature as a whole.

#### C. Consequences of Sampling Bias

Sampling bias can lead to incorrect conclusions about general human behavior. It is essential to consider the potential for sampling bias when designing studies and interpreting results.

### II. Dual Processing Tradition
#### A. Introduction to the Dual Processing Tradition

The dual processing tradition proposes that there are two relatively autonomous mechanisms for processing information: system one, which is evolutionarily primitive, unconscious, and automatic; and system two, which is conscious, effortful, and slow. System one recognizes patterns in the world, while system two applies principles.

#### B. Key Concepts in the Dual Processing Tradition

*   **System One**: Evolutionarily primitive, unconscious, and automatic processing mechanism that recognizes patterns in the world.
*   **System Two**: Conscious, effortful, and slow processing mechanism that applies principles.
*   **Alief**: Automatic, habitual ways in which our brains respond to certain stimuli, often without us even realizing it.

#### C. Examples of Dual Processing

*   The Wason selection task illustrates how people struggle with abstract reasoning but excel when faced with socially embedded rules.
*   Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's famous Asian disease problem demonstrated how people's preferences for a treatment plan can be influenced by framing effects, with some preferring certainty over probability when framed positively, but opting for the probabilistic option when framed negatively.

### III. Heuristic Biases
#### A. Introduction to Heuristic Biases

Heuristic biases refer to mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that people use to make decisions and judgments. These biases can lead to systematic errors in thinking and decision-making.

#### B. Examples of Heuristic Biases

*   The distinction between frequency and probability is an example of a heuristic bias, which will be explored further in the semester.
*   The ice cream choice experiment demonstrated how participants' preferences change depending on whether they are asked to choose or give up an option.

### IV. Alief
#### A. Introduction to Alief

Alief refers to the automatic, habitual ways in which our brains respond to certain stimuli, often without us even realizing it. This can be seen in situations where we have a belief about something, but an alief kicks in, causing us to react differently.

#### B. Examples of Alief

*   When watching a Western movie and bullets are flying off the screen, we may bend down, not because we believe we're in danger, but because our alief system tells us to do so.
*   Similarly, when seeing a delicious-looking cake, our alief system may override our belief that it's unhealthy, causing us to crave it.
