### I. Introduction to Rawls and Nozick's Philosophical Works
#### A. Overview of Key Concepts: Justice vs. Rights

Today's lecture contrasts the opening pages of John Rawls' Theory of Justice with Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia. These two influential works in political philosophy address the legitimacy of state power but differ profoundly in their core concepts: justice versus rights.

Rawls views **justice** as a fundamental virtue that denies the loss of freedom for some being made right by a greater good shared by others. In contrast, Nozick sees **individual rights** as inviolable and argues that any state more extensive than the minimal one violates people's rights.

#### B. Rawls' Concept of Justice

Rawls' theory emphasizes the importance of justice in society. He believes that justice is a fundamental virtue that ensures fairness and equality among citizens. According to Rawls, justice is not just about individual rights but also about the collective good. However, this approach raises questions about how to balance individual freedoms with the greater good.

#### C. Nozick's Concept of Rights

Nozick, on the other hand, prioritizes **individual rights** over collective justice. He argues that individuals have inherent rights that cannot be compromised for the sake of society as a whole. According to Nozick, any state intervention in individual affairs is unjust unless it is strictly necessary to protect basic rights.

### II. Nozick's Notion of Justice in Holdings
#### A. Original Acquisition and Transfer

Nozick appeals to John Locke's idea that individuals have property rights over their labor and its products. He argues that appropriation of private property satisfies the intent behind the "enough and as good left over" proviso. This means that individuals can acquire property by mixing their labor with natural resources, as long as there is enough for everyone else.

#### B. The Induction Clause

Nozick defends the induction clause by distinguishing between **historical** and **end-result principles** in justice. He argues that a society's justice cannot be judged solely by how its goods are distributed. Instead, he suggests that procedural justice is crucial in determining the fairness of a distribution.

#### C. Procedural Justice

Nozick emphasizes the importance of **procedural justice**, which ensures that whatever outcome arises from following a procedure is considered fair. This principle applies to various scenarios, including gambling, where the distribution of outcomes is legitimate regardless of the results.

### III. Critique and Implications
#### A. Limitations of Nozick's Theory

Critics argue that Nozick's theory doesn't account for situations where individual transactions have **third-party consequences** or where unequal distributions of resources can lead to violations of freedoms. This raises questions about the effectiveness of procedural justice in addressing these issues.

#### B. The Wilt Chamberlain Example

Nozick uses the example of Wilt Chamberlain to illustrate his point that liberty upsets patterns and requires continuous interference in people's lives. He argues that maintaining a pattern requires interfering with people's freedom to transfer resources as they wish, while the normative implication suggests that even if distributions change, no injustice has occurred if the process was fair.

#### C. Conclusion

Nozick's theory of justice in holdings offers an alternative perspective on the legitimacy of state power and individual rights. While it provides a nuanced understanding of procedural justice, it also raises important questions about its limitations and implications for social justice.
