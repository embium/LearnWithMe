### I. Aristotle's Concept of Virtue
#### A. Introduction to Habituation and Virtuous Actions

Aristotle's concept of virtue in The Nicomachean Ethics emphasizes the importance of habituation in acquiring virtues of character. However, he also notes that simply performing virtuous actions is not sufficient on its own; one must also be in the right state when doing so. This lecture will delve into Book two, Chapter four of The Nicomachean Ethics to explore Aristotle's ideas on the conditions necessary for an action to be considered virtuous.

#### B. Conditions for Virtuous Actions

Aristotle identifies three essential conditions for an action to count as virtuous:

*   **Knowing**: The agent must do the action knowingly, with a clear understanding of what they are doing.
*   **Decision**: The agent must decide to perform the action because it is virtuous, not just due to external circumstances or lack of opportunity.
*   **State of Character**: The agent must act from a firm and unchanging state of character, rather than simply going through the motions.

Aristotle also imposes a fourth condition, which involves taking pleasure or pain following one's actions as a sign of their state. This means that the virtuous person experiences a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment when performing virtuous actions, and takes pleasure in doing so.

#### C. Examples and Illustrations

To illustrate these conditions, Aristotle uses examples such as:

*   Acting temperately only because one lacks the opportunity for intemperate behavior.
*   Doing just acts without aiming to be just.

These examples highlight the importance of being in the right state when performing virtuous actions, rather than simply going through the motions.

#### D. Relationship to Flow and Positive Psychology

Aristotle's idea of virtue is seen as similar to the concept of flow in positive psychology, which involves being fully absorbed in an activity that is challenging yet manageable. The virtuous person experiences a sense of effortless engagement with their actions, without feeling the need to overcome alternative temptations.

This experience is characterized by a profound match between one's skill level and the challenge presented by the activity, leading to feelings of excitement, relaxation, or thrill of control. The lecture will conclude by examining how this understanding of virtue can be applied to real-life situations, highlighting the importance of being fully engaged in activities that are challenging yet manageable.

### II. Critique of Aristotle's Theory
#### A. Introduction to Social Psychology and Circumstance

The concept of morality is often tied to an individual's character, with the assumption that a person's moral behavior is determined by their inherent traits. However, research in social psychology suggests that this may not be the case.

A study on the Good Samaritan parable found that participants who were in a rush to deliver a lecture were less likely to help someone in need, despite having prepared a sermon on the importance of helping others. This challenges the Aristotelian theory, which posits that character is the primary determinant of action.

#### B. Studies Supporting Circumstance as Primary Determinant

Other studies, such as the Milgram experiments and cases of "moral luck," demonstrate that people's actions are often influenced by external circumstances rather than their character. These findings suggest that circumstance, not character, is the primary determinant of action.

John Doris argues that the Aristotelian theory has a faulty picture of human psychology and that circumstance plays a more significant role in determining behavior. This idea challenges the traditional view of morality as being determined by an individual's character, and highlights the importance of considering external circumstances when evaluating moral behavior.
