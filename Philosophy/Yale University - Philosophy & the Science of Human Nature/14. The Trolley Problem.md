### I. Introduction to Moral Theories
#### A. Overview of Deontology and Consequentialism

Moral theories provide frameworks for understanding right and wrong actions. Two prominent theories are deontology, which emphasizes duties and rules, and consequentialism, which focuses on the outcomes of actions. In this section, we'll explore Immanuel Kant's deontological theory, as presented in his Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals.

#### B. Key Claims of Deontology

Immanuel Kant's deontological theory is built upon three central claims:

*   **Claim 1: Duty and Moral Worth** - An action must be done from duty to have moral worth.
*   **Claim 2: Maxim and Purpose** - The moral worth of an action lies not in its purpose or goal, but rather in the maxim according to which it is determined.
*   **Claim 3: Respect for the Law** - Duty is the necessity of an action done out of respect for the law.

Kant's central notion of duty is defined as "the necessity of an action done out of respect for the law." This concept guides us in determining whether an action is moral or not.

#### C. The Categorical Imperative

Kant's theory leads to his famous formulation of the categorical imperative, which states that we should act only in accordance with a maxim that can be willed as a universal law. This principle prohibits first-person exceptionalism, where one takes their own needs as more important than those of others.

### II. The Trolley Problem
#### A. Overview of the Thought Experiment

The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment that raises questions about morality and decision-making. It involves a driver who must choose between killing five people by turning a trolley onto a track with one person or allowing the five to die.

#### B. Different Approaches to the Trolley Problem

Different philosophers have approached this problem in various ways:

*   **Philippa Foot's Hypothesis** - The choice is between killing one versus letting five die, which seems to capture our intuitions about what is morally right and wrong.
*   **The Bystander Case** - A bystander named Jim must choose between turning a trolley onto a track with one person or allowing it to kill five people. This case challenges Foot's hypothesis.

#### C. The Trolley Problem and Moral Dilemmas

The trolley problem presents a moral dilemma where diverting the trolley onto a track would kill one person, but letting five die is also unacceptable. In contrast to the doctor case, where most people thought it was wrong to kill one to save five, in this scenario, 85% of respondents think it's at least permitted to kill one to let five die.

#### D. The Bystander Case and Moral Concerns

However, when considering the bystander case, many people seem to think that letting five die is worse than killing one. This inconsistency raises questions about how to systematize intuitions on killing and letting die.

### III. Exploring Moral Theories
#### A. Using Someone as a Means to an End

One possible solution is to consider whether using someone as a means to an end is morally acceptable, as suggested by Kant's formula of humanity. However, this doesn't fully explain the bystander case, where diverting the trolley onto a track with one person would save five, but most people still think it's wrong to kill that one person.

#### B. Rights and Utility

Another possible explanation is that rights take precedence over utility, and violating someone's right to bodily integrity is morally prohibited. This hypothesis will be tested in the final example, where pushing a fat man off a bridge to stop the trolley from killing five would raise similar moral concerns.
