### I. Tying Up Loose Ends: Addressing Questions from Directed Exercise Nine
#### A. Overview and Context

Today's lecture aims to address questions raised in directed exercise nine, providing detailed answers to selected queries of general interest. This discussion will also serve as a precursor to Thursday's lecture, where the relation between individual articles and the larger framework will be explored.

#### B. Considering the Shape, Structure, and Relational Frameworks of Articles and Books

When encountering an article or book, it is essential to consider its general shape, structure, and how it relates to other approaches. This involves analyzing the author's perspective, methodology, and conclusions within the broader context of existing knowledge.

#### C. Case Study: Cass Sunstein's 1996 Article on Social Norms

Cass Sunstein's 1996 article on social norms serves as a case study for this discussion. Key points from the article include:

*   **Social norms determine social meanings**, influencing attitudes towards certain behaviors or decisions.
*   The distinction between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept payment (WTA) is crucial, with WTP being more relevant in Western societies.
*   Research suggests that the endowment effect, where people value owned objects more than identical ones not owned by them, is not fully explained by social norms.

#### D. The Trolley Case: Emotional vs. Rational Responses

The trolley case, where people respond differently depending on whether they're asked to push someone off a bridge or divert a trolley onto a track with one person, can be attributed to different modes of thought: emotional vs. rational responses. This asymmetry highlights the importance of considering multiple perspectives and understanding how human understanding proceeds in multiple ways.

#### E. Dual-Processing Tradition

The dual-processing tradition suggests that human understanding proceeds in multiple ways, with System One being automatic and effortless, while System Two is controlled and effortful. This concept is essential for analyzing complex issues and making informed decisions.

### II. The Relation Between Nozick and Rawls
#### A. Overview and Context

This section will explore the relation between Nozick and Rawls, using Thomas Pogge's framework to highlight their similarities and differences.

#### B. Hobbes' Argument: Escaping the State of Nature through Rationality

Hobbes argues that a social contract is of prudential utility, involving escaping the state of nature through rationality and instituting an authoritarian government to compel non-defection. Key steps in Hobbes' argument include:

*   **Rationality**: Hobbes proposes that individuals can escape the state of nature by using their rational faculties.
*   **Authoritarian Government**: He suggests that a strong, centralized authority is necessary to maintain order and prevent defection.

#### C. Rawls' Original Position: Choosing Basic Structures for Society

Rawls proposes the original position behind the veil of ignorance, where we choose basic structures for society with the aim of articulating a just society. Key principles of justice include:

*   **Equal Liberty**: Rawls suggests that all individuals should have equal liberty and freedom.
*   **Fair Equality of Opportunity**: He argues that everyone should have an equal chance to succeed.

#### D. Nozick's Historical Scenario: Determining the Just Distribution of Resources

Nozick focuses on a historical scenario where a particular distribution of resources has resulted from just transfers. Key points in his argument include:

*   **Just Transfers**: Nozick suggests that any contract entered into with free will is similarly situated.
*   **Minimal State**: He concludes that any intervention in such a justly generated distribution would be a violation of rights, advocating for the minimal state as the structurally mandated mechanism.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. Recap and Key Takeaways

This discussion has addressed questions raised in directed exercise nine, providing detailed answers to selected queries of general interest. Key takeaways include:

*   The importance of considering the shape, structure, and relational frameworks of articles and books.
*   The distinction between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept payment (WTA).
*   The dual-processing tradition and its implications for human understanding.
*   The relation between Nozick and Rawls, including their similarities and differences.

#### B. Future Directions

Thursday's lecture will explore the relation between individual articles and the larger framework, providing further context and analysis.
