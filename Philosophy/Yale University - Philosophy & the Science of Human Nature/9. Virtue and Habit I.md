### I. Aristotle's Concept of Habits and Virtue
#### A. Introduction to Habit Formation

Aristotle's ethics emphasize the importance of habits in developing virtues. He argues that by cultivating certain habits, individuals can create patterns of behavior that become automatized over time. This concept is central to understanding how societies should be structured to promote pro-social behavior.

#### B. Normative and Descriptive Laws

Aristotle distinguishes between normative laws, which express how things ought to be, and descriptive laws, which describe how things actually are. Habits serve as tools for turning normative commitments into descriptive laws by allowing individuals to create patterns of behavior that become automatized over time.

#### C. The Role of Operant Conditioning

The concept of operant conditioning is relevant to understanding how habits are formed and maintained. By associating behaviors with consequences, individuals can increase or decrease the likelihood of desired or undesired behaviors. This includes using positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and prompts to encourage desired behaviors.

#### D. Strategies for Self-Regulation and Change

Understanding how habits are formed and maintained provides a framework for developing strategies for self-regulation and change. This includes:

* Limiting access to cues that trigger undesired behaviors
* Using positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and prompts to encourage desired behaviors
* Focusing on the behavior we want to cultivate and reinforcing its opposite

#### E. The Difference Between Reason and Appetite

Aristotle's approach leverages the difference between reason and appetite by associating previously unreinforced behaviors with positive consequences. This allows individuals to develop stronger and longer-lasting habits, rather than relying on punishment or temporary effects.

#### F. Examples of Habit Formation

Examples of habit formation include:

* Abstaining from pleasure making us temperate
* Habituation in standing firm in frightening situations making us brave

However, as discussed in the essays for next class, this approach may not entirely describe what's required for bringing about desired change.

### II. Implications for Personal and Societal Well-being
#### A. The Importance of Structuring Experience

Aristotle's insight that "if you want to become something, act as if that is what you already were" highlights the importance of structuring experience in a way that allows for the development of desired habits.

#### B. Creating Environments that Promote Pro-Social Behavior

The concept of habit formation has implications for how societies should be structured to promote pro-social behavior. By creating environments that encourage desired behaviors, individuals can develop virtues and contribute to societal well-being.

### III. Conclusion
#### A. The Framework of Operant Conditioning

The framework of operant conditioning provides a way to structure our lives so that desired behaviors become habitual by making them incompatible with undesired ones. This approach leverages the difference between reason and appetite, allowing us to associate previously unreinforced behaviors with positive consequences.

#### B. Turning Normative Commitments into Descriptions of Behaviors

By structuring our lives in this way, we can turn normative commitments into descriptions of behaviors that come naturally to us, making them laws rather than just good ideas.
