### I. The Concept of the Soul as a Divided Entity
#### A. Historical Roots and Ancient Greek Literature

The concept of the soul being divided into different parts that often conflict with one another has its roots in ancient Greek literature and philosophy. This idea is exemplified in Plato's story of Leontius, who struggles with his appetite for something he knows is wrong (Plato, Republic). Similarly, Medea from Ovid's Metamorphosis finds herself torn between reason and desire, illustrating the fundamental trope of human nature being pulled in different directions.

This concept is not limited to ancient Greek literature; it also reflects modern cultural experiences. For instance, when choosing a winning team in basketball betting or deciding whether to follow one's heart or head, individuals often face internal conflicts that mirror the divisions of the soul. The lecture will explore various philosophical and psychological theories that attempt to explain these divisions.

#### B. Plato's Tripartite Division

In his philosophical works, particularly in the Phaedrus and Republic, Plato presents a tripartite model of the human soul, comprising reason, spirit, and appetite. Reason is depicted as a charioteer, guiding the soul towards virtue and self-control, while spirit is represented by a noble horse that can be controlled through word alone. Appetite, on the other hand, is portrayed as a wild and unruly beast that must be tamed and trained through negative associations and self-regulation.

This process involves the charioteer using force to bring the dark horse into line, illustrating the struggle between reason and passion. Plato's model suggests that in a well-ordered soul, reason rules over spirit and appetite, which are brought into harmony with what reason dictates. This concept is then applied to society, where guardians (guided by reason), auxiliaries (governed by honor), and workers (driven by appetite) work together in harmony.

#### C. Other Theories of the Divided Soul

Other philosophers have also proposed theories of the divided soul:

*   **Hume's Discussion of Reason and Passion**: David Hume argued that reason is often at odds with passion, leading to conflicting desires and emotions.
*   **Freud's Theory of the Id, Ego, and Superego**: Sigmund Freud proposed a tripartite model of the psyche, consisting of the id (instinctual drives), ego (rational thinking), and superego (moral principles). This theory suggests that the individual's internal conflicts arise from the struggle between these three components.
*   **Jonathan Haidt's Distinction Between Old Brain and New Brain**: Jonathan Haidt proposed a distinction between the old brain (associated with instinctual drives) and the new brain (linked to rational thinking). He argued that humans are often torn between these two aspects, leading to internal conflicts.

#### D. Controlled and Automatic Processing

The lecture will also discuss controlled and automatic processing, using a study by John Bargh to illustrate how our thoughts and behaviors can be influenced unconsciously. This concept is essential in understanding the divided soul, as it highlights the complex interplay between conscious and unconscious processes that shape human behavior.

#### E. Conclusion and Future Lectures

The discussion of Plato's tripartite soul sets the stage for next lecture's exploration of dual processing accounts in the context of two pieces: Daniel Kahneman's Nobel Prize acceptance speech and a written piece on the notion of alief, which aims to bring together ideas from today's discussion.
