### I. The Concept of Non-Rational Persuasion in Government
#### A. Introduction to the Social Contract Argument

The social contract theory suggests that individuals give up certain freedoms in exchange for stability and protection provided by a governing body. This concept is central to understanding how governments interact with their citizens, particularly when it comes to issues like censorship and regulation of fictional representations.

#### B. The Prisoner's Dilemma Paradox: Conflict Between Self-Interest and Rationality

The Prisoner's Dilemma paradox highlights the tension between individual self-interest and collective rationality. In this scenario, two prisoners must decide whether to confess or remain silent, with each prisoner's decision affecting the outcome for both. This paradox illustrates how human beings often prioritize their own interests over what is considered rational or beneficial for society as a whole.

#### C. The Role of Non-Rational Parts of the Soul in Political Structures

Philosophers like Plato have long recognized that human beings are not solely driven by reason, but also by emotions and other non-rational factors. This understanding has significant implications for how we design political structures and make decisions about censorship, regulation, and social norms.

### II. The Impact of Fictional Representations on Attitudes
#### A. Examples from Popular Culture

Two stories illustrate the potential impact of fictional representations on attitudes: the controversy surrounding Murphy Brown's portrayal of an unmarried mother and the depiction of a female President on the TV show 24. These examples demonstrate how observing fictional circumstances can lead to mischosen role models or profound emotional responses.

#### B. Plato's Concerns About Fictional Representations

Plato is concerned about three ways in which fiction can problematically affect the soul, but not playful imitation, which involves engaging with material at a distance. He argues that early education should cultivate appropriate spirit and appetite in guardians, and that censorship of poetry is necessary to prevent harm to youth.

#### C. The Importance of Shaping Young People's Attitudes Through Narratives

Plato's discussion on censorship and education highlights the importance of shaping young people's attitudes through narratives, as seen in Mister Cookie Monster's transformation. He worries about the risk of contagion from fiction to reality, particularly when emotions run loose due to sufficient similarity between the two cases.

### III. The Concept of Using Fantasy to Aid Social Regulation
#### A. Examples from Video Games and Military Training

The concept of using fantasy to aid social regulation is explored through various examples, including the videogame Madden NFL 12, which simulates concussions and sidelines players for the rest of the game, and the US military's use of video games like America's Army as a training tool for soldiers. In both cases, the technology facilitates a revolution in the art of warfare or social behavior, allowing individuals to cultivate their bodies and minds in ways that prepare them for real-world challenges.

#### B. Questions About Plato's Argument on Fiction and the Soul

This raises questions about Plato's argument that fiction can affect the non-rational parts of the soul, potentially causing disharmony between rational and non-rational responses. According to Plato, this can be mitigated by regulating exposure to certain experiences through societal decisions, rather than relying on individual reason alone.

#### C. Implications for Political Structures

This idea is reminiscent of Hobbes' argument for a sovereign who enforces contracts, and it highlights the complexities of creating political structures that accommodate human limitations.
