### I. Introduction to Community Status and Harmony
#### A. Overview of the Third Unit

The third unit of this course delves into the concept of community status and harmony, drawing parallels with individual harmony. This section will explore how philosophical frameworks, such as those presented in Plato's Republic, can inform our understanding of community dynamics. The discussion on punishment from the previous lecture serves as a microcosm for this transition, examining deontological and consequentialist theories alongside their implications for behavior and justification.

#### B. Philosophical Frameworks for Community Harmony

This unit will draw upon various philosophical works to explore the concept of community harmony. Key texts include Plato's Republic, which discusses the ideal society and its governance, and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, which examines virtues and moral character in relation to individual and societal contexts.

- **Deontological Theories**: These theories emphasize the importance of rules and duties over consequences. In a community context, deontological approaches might focus on upholding laws and social norms.
- **Consequentialist Theories**: These theories prioritize outcomes and consequences. In a community setting, consequentialist approaches might consider the effects of actions on individuals and society as a whole.

#### C. Psychological Factors Influencing Community Harmony

The discussion on punishment highlighted the importance of considering psychological factors in understanding behavior and justification. This section will explore how Alan Kazdin's work on parenting guides can inform our understanding of community dynamics, particularly in relation to rehabilitation and restitution for victims.

- **Restitution and Rehabilitation**: These approaches focus on repairing harm done to individuals or communities rather than solely punishing perpetrators.
- **Moral Luck**: The concept of moral luck refers to the idea that outcomes can be influenced by factors outside an individual's control. This section will examine how moral luck relates to personal and societal contexts in community harmony.

#### D. Hobbes' Philosophy on Community Status

Thomas Hobbes' philosophy provides a framework for understanding the challenges of achieving community status. His concept of commodious living encompasses the necessities that can be achieved through cooperation, such as buildings, learning, comfort, stability, and other social benefits.

- **The State of Nature**: Hobbes describes human beings in the state of nature as driven by self-preservation and a desire for liberty, leading to a war of all against all.
- **Laws of Nature**: To address this challenge, Hobbes proposes three laws of nature:
  - Seek peace if possible, but engage in war if not.
  - Be willing to lay down one's rights to the extent that others do so, promoting a peaceful state.
  - Perform covenants and ensure their enforcement through coercive power.

#### E. Conclusion and Future Directions

This section will conclude by highlighting the central dilemma posed by Hobbes' solution: whether an external sovereign is indeed the only way to resolve the conflict between individual interests and collective well-being. The next lecture will explore this dilemma in more depth, examining the implications of Hobbes' philosophy for community status and harmony.

### II. Conclusion
#### A. Recap of Key Points

This unit has explored the concept of community status and harmony through various philosophical frameworks, including deontological and consequentialist theories. It has also examined psychological factors influencing community dynamics, such as restitution and rehabilitation, and the role of moral luck in responses to punishment.

#### B. Future Directions

The next lecture will delve into the implications of Hobbes' philosophy for community status and harmony, examining whether an external sovereign is indeed the only way to resolve the conflict between individual interests and collective well-being.
