### I. Aristotle's Moral Theory: Emphasis on Character and Practical Wisdom
#### A. Critique by Contemporary Social Psychologists

Aristotle's moral theory places significant importance on character and practical wisdom in determining action. However, a critique by contemporary social psychologists suggests that this approach commits the fundamental attribution error. This error occurs when behavior is attributed solely to character rather than circumstance.

The fundamental attribution error is supported by various psychological studies, including:

*   The Good Samaritan study: Participants were more likely to help someone in need if they were in a good mood and had a positive attitude towards helping.
*   The Milgram experiments: Participants were more likely to administer electric shocks to another person when instructed to do so by an authority figure.

These studies demonstrate that circumstances can significantly influence behavior, challenging Aristotle's emphasis on character alone. Nevertheless, research in personality psychology highlights the importance of individual traits, established early in life, which correlate with a range of measures, including self-regulation.

#### B. The Importance of Individual Differences

Walter Mischel's deferred gratification studies show that early capacity for self-regulation is highly predictive of various outcomes. This suggests that individual differences play a significant role in behavior. Aristotle's theory acknowledges this complexity by distinguishing between virtue and vice, as well as temperance and intemperance.

*   Virtue: Involves inclination towards the right thing without the stability of character.
*   Vice: Involves inclination towards the wrong thing without the stability of character.
*   Temperance: Involves inclination towards the right thing with some degree of stability, but not enough to overcome conflicting inclinations.
*   Intemperance: Involves inclination towards the wrong thing with some degree of stability, but not enough to overcome conflicting inclinations.

The concept of continence and incontinence further illustrates the nuances of human decision-making. Continence involves knowing what is right but struggling to act on it due to conflicting inclinations. Incontinence involves acting on one's desires without considering the consequences.

#### C. Understanding Human Behavior through Aristotle's Ideas

Aristotle's ideas on self-regulation and the role of individual differences are relevant to understanding human behavior. The concept of temptation can be understood through the metaphor of Odysseus and the sirens, where one must render themselves unable to act on temptation by external constraints or internal commitments.

*   External constraints: Involving separating oneself from the ability to act on temptation, such as turning off the internet or removing temptations from one's environment.
*   Internal commitments: Involving binding oneself to a principle that guides decision-making and helps overcome temptation. This can be achieved through principles that group actions under a general rubric, making it easier to make decisions based on past experiences and future goals.

Principles also provide a way of overcoming sunk costs, where one's tendency not to ignore investments made in the future can help choose the smaller, sooner reward over the larger, later one. By understanding these concepts, students have gained a philosophical framework for placing discussions on procrastination and irrational behavior.

### II. Applying Aristotle's Ideas through Directed Exercises and Essays
#### A. Exploring Psychology Articles

Students will explore psychology articles that discuss the importance of individual differences in determining behavior. This will involve analyzing research studies and identifying key findings related to self-regulation, temptation, and decision-making.

#### B. Experiment Design

Students will design experiments to test the effects of external constraints and internal commitments on human behavior. This will involve developing hypotheses, selecting participants, and implementing experimental procedures.

#### C. Course Design

Students will design a course that incorporates Aristotle's ideas on self-regulation and the role of individual differences in determining behavior. This will involve developing lesson plans, selecting readings, and designing activities to engage students in critical thinking and discussion.

By applying Aristotle's ideas through directed exercises and essays, students will gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and develop skills in research design, experiment implementation, and course development.
