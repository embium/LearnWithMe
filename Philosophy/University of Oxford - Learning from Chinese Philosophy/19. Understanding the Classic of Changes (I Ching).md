### I. The Classic of Changes: An Ancient Chinese Divination Text
#### A. Origins and Structure

The Classic of Changes, also known as the I Ching, is an ancient Chinese divination text that has been influential in various cultures for over 3000 years. Its origins date back to the oracle bone inscriptions used for divination purposes during this time period. The I Ching consists of 64 hexagrams, each composed of six lines that can be either broken or unbroken. These hexagrams are accompanied by a set of judgments and line statements associated with them.

#### B. Methods of Divination

In modern times, the I Ching has been used for divination purposes through various methods, including:

*   The yarrow stalk method: This traditional method involves using 50 yarrow stalks to generate random numbers that correspond to specific hexagrams.
*   The three coin method: This more modern approach uses three coins tossed six times to determine the lines of a hexagram.

#### C. Influence on Modern Thought

Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, was interested in the I Ching and its concept of synchronicity. He saw parallels between the ancient Chinese mind's contemplation of the cosmos and modern physics' understanding of reality as a psychophysical structure. Jung argued that the I Ching could be seen as a tool for accessing non-standard causality, which is more plausible when considering the principles of quantum mechanics.

### II. The Concept of Yin and Yang
#### A. Complementary Opposites

The I Ching's hexagrams are thought to represent the fundamental principles of yin and yang, which are complementary opposites that work cyclically in the universe. By examining the transformations between yin and yang, the I Ching establishes a system of numbers and trigrams that can be used for divination or as a philosophical framework.

#### B. The Diagram of the Great Ultimate

The text's philosophy is rooted in the idea that everything in the universe is unified but manifests itself in a genuine plurality and diversity. This concept is reflected in the diagram of the great ultimate, which shows how the ultimate source of reality generates yin and yang, then the five phases, and ultimately the myriad things in the universe.

### III. The I Ching's Metaphysics
#### A. Influence on Chinese Thought

The I Ching's metaphysics has been influential in Chinese thought, particularly among neo-Confucian philosophers who saw it as a way to validate the importance of everyday life and relationships while still acknowledging the unity of all things.

#### B. The Neo-Confucian Interpretation

The neo-Confucians' interpretation of the Great Ultimate emphasizes its role in unifying various metaphysical and cosmological concepts, such as yin and yang, five phases, and chi. This view also acknowledges the plurality of things, recognizing that the Great Ultimate manifests itself in different ways, giving rise to a multitude of entities.

#### C. Critique of Buddhism

The neo-Confucians criticize Buddhism for emphasizing unity at the expense of plurality, advocating instead for a holistic approach that integrates individual desires and attachments into the world's problems.

### IV. The Debate on Dualism
#### A. Concerns about Separation

However, this interpretation raises concerns about dualism, with some later Confucians arguing that it separates pattern from qi, potentially leading to a monistic view where everything is considered a single entity.

#### B. Echoes of Earlier Buddhist Discussions

This debate echoes earlier Buddhist discussions on the nature of reality and the importance of avoiding dualism, highlighting the complexities of understanding the Great Ultimate and its relationship to the world.
