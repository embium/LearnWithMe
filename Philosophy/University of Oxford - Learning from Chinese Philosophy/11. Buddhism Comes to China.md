### I. The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Society
#### A. Introduction to Buddhist Practices in China

The arrival of Buddhism in China brought significant changes to the country's social and cultural landscape. One of the most notable changes was the introduction of a celibate clergy, which was puzzling to people in the Chinese tradition who valued filial piety and having children as a way to continue the family line. This shift in values raised questions about the role of Buddhist monks and nuns in society.

#### B. The Adoption of Veganism and Changes in Personal Identity

Buddhist monks and nuns also adopted the practice of not eating meat, which became an option for many Buddhists at the time. This new concept of veganism was a departure from traditional Chinese values, where food played a significant role in social gatherings and family celebrations. The practice of shaving one's hair off, wearing distinctive clothing, and changing one's name when taking vows further emphasized the distinctiveness of Buddhist monks and nuns.

#### C. Philosophical Arguments to Justify Buddhist Practices

To address concerns about the impact of Buddhism on Chinese society, scholars like Huiyuan developed philosophical arguments to justify the behavior of Buddhist monks and nuns. In his work on why Buddhist monks do not bow down before kings, Huiyuan distinguished between lay Buddhists who followed the eightfold path but remained in their families, and those who had left their families to become monks or nuns. He argued that the latter group was no longer bound by conventional filial piety and social norms, as they sought to transcend the physical world and its suffering.

### II. The Development of Buddhist Philosophy in China
#### A. Huiyuan's Defense of Buddhism

Huiyuan's philosophical arguments emphasized the idea that Buddhist monks and nuns were not a threat to social order, but rather a means of benefiting society through their spiritual practices. He argued that the pursuit of enlightenment was a higher calling than the demands of family and social obligations.

#### B. Zongmi's Defense of Huayan Buddhism

Another scholar, Zongmi, developed a more philosophical defense of Buddhism by arguing that Confucianism and Taoism had some truths, but were incomplete and lacked awareness. He claimed that Huayan Buddhism was the most comprehensive understanding, with Theravada Buddhism being almost as good but not quite as profound.

#### C. The Problem of Evil in Chinese Philosophy

The concept of a teleological worldview, where a higher power structures the world with a built-in purpose, goal, or end, raises issues about why heaven or God seems to give people different life circumstances. This problem is known as theodicy, specifically the problem of evil, which questions why bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people.

### III. Key Concepts in Buddhist Philosophy
#### A. The Doctrine of No Self

The doctrine of no self, as interpreted by Theravada Buddhism, suggests that physical existence or human consciousness is like the flowing of a stream or the flickering of a lamp - constantly changing. This view implies that our mental states are also in a constant state of change, and we cling to them as if they were a constant "I" or self.

#### B. The Three Poisons

The three poisons of craving, anger, and delusion stir up thoughts and instigate actions that create negative karmic consequences. According to this doctrine, the persistence of these transient physical and mental states over time is problematic, suggesting there must be an eternal ground explaining their continuing existence.

#### C. Panpsychism

The problem of consciousness arises when considering how conscious states emerge from seemingly unconscious physical matter; one solution is panpsychism, the view that matter itself is conscious at some level.

### IV. The Hierarchical Arrangement of Spiritual Paths
#### A. The Relative Merits of Different Philosophies

This hierarchical arrangement of spiritual paths suggests a deeper understanding of the nature of reality, and is an idea worth considering when evaluating the relative merits of different philosophies.
