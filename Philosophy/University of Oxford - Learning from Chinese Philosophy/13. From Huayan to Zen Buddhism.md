### I. Introduction to Hawaiian Buddhism
#### A. Overview of Hawaiian Buddhism's Influence on Zen Buddhism

Hawaiian Buddhism, also known as Huayan Buddhism in China, played a significant role in the development of Chan Buddhism, which is commonly referred to as Zen in the West. This distinctive form of Buddhism emerged in China and contributed to the evolution of Chan Buddhism, emphasizing practices like seated meditation (zazen) and koans. Understanding Hawaiian Buddhism's influence on Zen Buddhism provides valuable context for exploring these practices further.

#### B. Key Texts: Fodzong's Essay on the Golden Lion and the Platform Sutra

Two essential texts in understanding Hawaiian Buddhism are Fodzong's essay on the Golden Lion and the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch. These texts illustrate key concepts in Huayan Buddhism, such as the unity and interconnectedness of all things. The Golden Lion represents the underlying pattern of relationships among everything in the universe, while its shape is an illusory perception of independent individuals.

### II. Key Concepts in Hawaiian Buddhism
#### A. Emptiness of Appearances and Dependent Arising

Fodzong's essay on the Golden Lion highlights the emptiness of appearances and the doctrine of dependent arising. This concept posits that a thing's characteristic arises from causation, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all phenomena. The Platform Sutra further develops this idea by discussing the difference between substance and function.

#### B. Substance and Function

The Platform Sutra explains the importance of understanding the distinction between substance and function. This concept is crucial in Buddhist philosophy and later in neo-Confucian thought, allowing for multiple aspects of reality to be emphasized without introducing dualism. The example of a lamp and its light illustrates this idea, where the substance (lamp) and function (light) are inseparable.

### III. Chan Buddhism and Its Emphasis on Direct Experience
#### A. Attainment of Enlightenment through Direct Experience

Chan Buddhism, also known as Zen in the West, emphasizes the attainment of enlightenment through direct experience. The Platform Sutra tells the story of how the Fifth Patriarch passes on the leadership of the Chan school to Hui-neng, an illiterate peasant monk, rather than Shun-sho, who was considered the most advanced monk at the time.

#### B. Overcoming Dualisms and Emphasizing Unity

The sutra discusses the importance of overcoming dualisms such as stability and insight, which are seen as two aspects of one state rather than separate entities. This is illustrated through examples like a lamp and its light, where the substance (lamp) and function (light) are inseparable.

### IV. Mindfulness and Being Fully Concentrated in the Present Moment
#### A. Cultivating Deep Enlightenment

By not getting attached to thoughts and staying in the moment, one can cultivate deep enlightenment into the truth that all is one and one is all. This concept is part of what Buddhists mean by mindfulness â€“ being fully concentrated in the current situation.

#### B. Practical Applications: Meditation and Other Practices

Next week, we will explore practical ways Chan monks try to achieve this understanding through meditation and other practices. Understanding these methods provides valuable context for further exploration and application in one's own life.
