### I. The Development of Mature Neo-Confucianism in China
#### A. Intellectual Traditions Influencing Neo-Confucian Thought

The development of mature neo-Confucianism in China during the Song Dynasty was influenced by earlier intellectual traditions, including Buddhism and Confucian thought. Philosophers like Zhang Zai and Zhu Xi synthesized earlier ideas, laying the groundwork for the emergence of neo-Confucianism as a distinct philosophical tradition.

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Li** (pattern): The structure of the universe present in all things.
    *   **Qi** (spatio-temporal stuff): A concept borrowed from Buddhism that individuates and characterizes things.
*   **The Synthesis of Confucian and Buddhist Ideas**

Neo-Confucians rejected certain Buddhist concepts, but their own metaphysics was shaped by Buddhist ideas. The notion of li and qi became central to neo-Confucian thought, with individuals believed to have the most clear and least turbid chi, allowing for greater understanding of the pattern.

*   **The Concept of Individuation**

The concept of individuation is central to understanding the nature of reality in neo-Confucianism. It explains how seemingly disparate entities can share a common underlying pattern, reflecting the idea that everything is connected by an intricate web of relationships.

#### B. The Role of Social and Intellectual Context

The development of mature neo-Confucianism was also influenced by the social and intellectual context of the time, including criticisms of Buddhism and the rise of Confucianism as a dominant ideology.

*   **Key Developments:**
    *   Criticisms of Buddhism
    *   The rise of Confucianism as a dominant ideology

#### C. The Metaphysics of Ju Shi

The Confucian philosopher Ju Shi developed a metaphysics that posits the existence of a fundamental pattern, which he referred to as "chi," that underlies all phenomena.

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Chi** (fundamental pattern): A concept that underlies all phenomena.
    *   **Individuation**: The process by which entities become distinct and unique.

#### D. Ethics and the Concept of Chi

The concept of chi has significant implications for ethics, as it suggests that individuals have genuine obligations to one another based on their shared membership in a larger whole.

*   **Key Ideas:**
    *   Obligations to others
    *   Shared membership in a larger whole

#### E. Education and Self-Cultivation

Ju Shi's philosophy emphasizes the importance of clarifying one's own chi through education and self-cultivation, which involves learning basic skills (lesser learning) and then developing a deeper understanding of the underlying pattern (greater learning).

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Lesser Learning**: The acquisition of basic skills.
    *   **Greater Learning**: The development of a deeper understanding of the underlying pattern.

#### F. Critique of Traditional Chinese Society

In traditional Chinese society, wealth and prestige were often sought through memorization of Confucian classics and regurgitation on examinations, a practice that contradicted the original intent of these teachings.

*   **Key Ideas:**
    *   Memorization and regurgitation
    *   Contradiction with the original intent of Confucian teachings

#### G. Jushi's Advice to Students

Jushi's advice to students is particularly relevant today, encouraging critical thinking and self-expression, urging people not to be afraid to question their elders or assert their own opinions, even if they are uninformed.

*   **Key Ideas:**
    *   Critical thinking
    *   Self-expression
