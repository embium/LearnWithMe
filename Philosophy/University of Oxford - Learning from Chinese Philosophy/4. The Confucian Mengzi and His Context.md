### I. The Significance of Mangza in East Asian Intellectual History
#### A. Overview of Mangza's Life and Influence

Mangza was a revered figure in East Asia, playing a significant role in shaping Chinese intellectual history. Despite being lesser-known in the West compared to Confucius, Mangza's ideas and influence on the Confucian tradition are substantial. His contributions have been likened to those of Paul in Christianity, highlighting his importance in the development of Eastern thought.

#### B. Historical Context: The Warring States Period

Mangza lived during the tumultuous Warring States period (475-221 BCE), a time marked by social chaos and intellectual ferment. This era was characterized by the absence of a centralized authority, with various states vying for power and competing armies causing widespread destruction. In this context, philosophers like Mangza emerged to address the pressing issues of their time.

#### C. Key Philosophical Contributions

Mangza's philosophy emphasized the importance of cultivating virtue in individuals and promoting impartial caring, which he believed would lead to a more harmonious society. He argued that ethics should be based on an objective standard, much like technical activities such as astronomy or carpentry, and that this standard should be impartial. This led him to conclude that people should maximize wealth, populousness, and order for everyone without showing favoritism.

#### D. Critique of Confucianism and Other Philosophers

Mangza's ideas were influential in shaping Chinese thought, particularly in the context of Confucianism, which he critiqued alongside other philosophers like Shunza and Yangju. While Confucius emphasized the importance of family relationships and agent-relative obligations, Mangza advocated for a more universal approach to ethics, prioritizing impartial caring and the promotion of beneficial consequences.

#### E. The Concept of Egoism

The concept of egoism is often misunderstood as being synonymous with psychological egoism, the idea that people are only motivated by self-interest. However, ethical egoism, a distinct view, argues that while people may sometimes act in ways that benefit others, they should primarily focus on their own well-being. This perspective was exemplified by Yangju, who believed that humans have an innate tendency towards self-interest and that acting otherwise is a perversion of human nature.

#### F. Mangza's Response to Egoism and Moism

Mangza's views were in response to the ideas of Yangju and Moism, which emphasize impartial caring and the rejection of self-interest. Through his arguments, Mangza demonstrated that humans have a natural inclination towards benevolence and righteousness, and that prioritizing these values can lead to greater profit and prosperity for individuals and society as a whole.

### II. Key Terms and Concepts
#### A. **Impartial Caring**

Impartial caring refers to the idea of promoting the well-being of all individuals without showing favoritism or partiality. This concept is central to Mangza's philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of cultivating virtue in individuals and promoting impartial caring.

#### B. **Egoism**

Egoism is a philosophical perspective that argues that individuals should prioritize their own interests and well-being above those of others. There are two distinct views within egoism: psychological egoism, which holds that people are only motivated by self-interest, and ethical egoism, which argues that individuals should primarily focus on their own well-being.

#### C. **Moism**

Moism is a philosophical school that emphasizes impartial caring and the rejection of self-interest. This perspective was exemplified by Mozi, who argued that humans have an innate tendency towards benevolence and righteousness.
