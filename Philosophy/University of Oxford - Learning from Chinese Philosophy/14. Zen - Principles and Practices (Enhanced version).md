### I. The Shenji Temple: A Center for Zen Monks' Training
#### A. Overview of the Temple's Significance

The Shenji Temple is a special center for Zen monks' training in central Japan, belonging to the Rinai school of Zen Buddhism. It serves as an important hub for intensive meditation and discourse periods, particularly during the Rohatsu Oin, which marks a climax in the monks' monastic life.

#### B. The Significance of Rohatsu Oin

Rohatsu Oin is a week-long period that begins on the Eighth Day of the 12th lunar month. During this time, the monks sit for seven days as if it were a single day, with no sleep or rest, to focus on meditation and self-reflection. This event measures the effectiveness of the past year's training and is significant in Zen practice.

#### C. The Purpose of Rohatsu Oin

The ultimate goal of Rohatsu Oin is to test the monks' determination and motivation, as well as their commitment to embarking on the Zen training path. The temple's training program is designed to prepare the monks for a life of self-discipline and mindfulness, which is essential in Zen practice.

#### D. Daily Routine During Rohatsu Oin

The daily routine during Rohatsu Oin includes morning seated meditation, visits to the Zen master for instruction, and meals served in a spirit of simplicity and gratitude. The dining room is an important place for training, where the monks learn to cultivate mindfulness and self-discipline through their eating habits.

#### E. The Role of the Zen Master

The Zen master plays a crucial role in guiding the monks through the Coan, a series of problems to be solved individually. The monks' struggles with the Coan are intense, but their zeal for finding Satori drives them forward.

### II. The Spirit of Chinese Zen
#### A. Emphasis on Manual Labor and Begging

The Shenji Temple's training program reflects the spirit of Chinese Zen, which emphasizes the importance of manual labor and begging as means of supporting daily life and reaching enlightenment. The temple's rice-growing activities are a testament to this philosophy.

#### B. Finding Enlightenment through Labor

In Rinai Zen, finding Enlightenment through Labor is considered more important than seated contemplation. This philosophy is reflected in the design of the te-room, which reduced space to a minimum, dimmed light, and emphasized silence, creating an atmosphere conducive to spiritual growth.

### III. The Connection between Zen and Japanese Culture
#### A. The Emergence of a Renowned Figure

During Japan's tumultuous Muromachi period, a renowned figure emerged as the hub of creative minds. This individual attracted writers, artists, actors, poets, and the founder of the Tea Ceremony to his circle, fostering a new era of medieval culture.

#### B. The Study of Zen under a Prominent Master

The connection between this figure and Juko, the founder of the Tea Ceremony, began with the study of Zen under a prominent master. This led to the formulation of a new, simpler way of tea-making that emphasized Wabi, a taste for simplicity and quiet.

#### C. The Philosophy of the Tea Ceremony

The Tea Ceremony aimed to become one with the mind, achieving the Awakening through the realization that the principles of Tao and Zen were one and the same. The host and guests became one in the serene atmosphere of the te-room, where silence and simplicity created a profound sense of peace and unity.

### IV. The Spirit of Zen in Japanese Art Forms
#### A. Calligraphy, Painting, and Poetry

The spirit of Zen is also evident in its art forms, such as calligraphy, painting, and poetry, which convey the essence of Satori or Enlightenment. These arts are not mere expressions but a means to transmit the truth and connect with others on a deeper level.

#### B. The Philosophy of Beauty

In this context, beauty is not just a form but an experience that arises from the negation of the self, allowing one to become completely at one with what they are doing. This philosophy has influenced various art forms in Japan, including the no dramas, martial arts, and the Tea Ceremony.

#### C. The Value of Simplicity, Naturalness, and Silence

This philosophy values simplicity, naturalness, and silence as essential elements of beauty, creating a unique cultural heritage that reflects the spirit of Zen.
