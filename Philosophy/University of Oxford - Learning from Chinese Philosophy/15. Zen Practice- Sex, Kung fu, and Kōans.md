### I. Metaphysical Dualism vs. Monism in Zen Buddhism
#### A. Overview of the Concept

Metaphysical dualism versus monism is a fundamental philosophical debate with significant implications for ethics, particularly in the context of Zen Buddhism. This distinction affects how we think about matters of value and our understanding of the self. In essence, dualists view reality as consisting of two fundamental kinds of things, whereas monists believe that there is ultimately only one thing that exists.

#### B. Dualism: The Separate Mind and Body

Descartes' philosophy exemplifies dualism by positing the existence of mind and body as separate substances. This perspective views the world as divided into distinct categories, with a clear distinction between the spiritual (mind) and physical (body). In this context, ethics often revolves around the idea of separating oneself from worldly desires and attachments to achieve a higher, more spiritual state.

#### C. Monism: The Interconnectedness of All Things

In contrast, Chan or Zen Buddhism advocates for a monistic view where everything is interconnected and one. This understanding dissolves distinctions between different aspects of reality, leading to a holistic approach to life. The idea that "nirvana is samsara" - that enlightenment is not a separate state but rather seeing the everyday world without attachment to illusion - reflects this monistic perspective.

#### D. Practical Implications of Monism in Zen Buddhism

The practical implications of this understanding are significant, as it encourages approaching everyday activities with detachment and mindfulness, rather than seeking spiritual transcendence. This approach dissolves distinctions between sacred and profane, reason and sensuality, leading to a more integrated and harmonious life.

#### E. The Influence of Taoist Philosophy on Zen Buddhism

The concept of enlightenment in Zen Buddhism is often misunderstood, particularly when it comes to the role of physical and sensual experiences. In this tradition, enlightenment can be expressed through various activities, such as calligraphy, painting, or martial arts, which help cultivate a monistic worldview where distinctions between self and others are transcended. This idea is rooted in the influence of Taoist philosophy on Buddhism, particularly through the teachings of Juan, who emphasized that it's in practical activities that one can express and cultivate enlightenment.

#### F. The Concept of "No-Self" or "Emptiness"

The concept of "no-self" or "emptiness" is central to this understanding, where the individual self is seen as an illusion, and true freedom and awareness arise from letting go of attachments and preconceptions. This perspective is reflected in the teachings of Zen masters, who often use paradoxical statements, known as koans, to challenge students' intellectual understanding and encourage them to see the world in a different way.

#### G. The Role of Koans in Challenging Dualistic Thinking

The goal of these teachings is not to achieve a specific state or status but to cultivate mindfulness and awareness in everyday life, allowing one to transcend dualistic thinking and experience the unity of all things. Koans are used to challenge students' intellectual understanding and encourage them to see the world in a different way.

#### H. The Concept of Self and Its Relationship to Enlightenment

The concept of the self and its relationship to enlightenment is a central theme in Zen Buddhism, as illustrated by various koans and anecdotes. A monk asked what the Buddha was, and Master Jiaozhou replied that he was not separate from the monk himself, since all is one and one is all. Similarly, when asked about his own identity, Master Zhaojo said that if the monk had eaten breakfast, then washing out his bowls would reveal his true self.

#### I. Examples of Transcending Dualistic Thinking

In another example, a Zen master killed a cat to illustrate the point that enlightenment cannot be achieved through verbal answers alone. The first patriarch of Chan Buddhism was said to have accepted a disciple only after he cut off his own arm as an offering, highlighting the extreme measures taken by some practitioners to demonstrate their dedication and transcendence of attachment.

#### J. Conclusion

These stories and others like them serve as a reminder that true understanding can only be achieved through direct experience, not through intellectual concepts or verbal explanations. The concept of metaphysical dualism versus monism in Zen Buddhism has significant implications for ethics, particularly in the context of everyday life. By transcending dualistic thinking and embracing a monistic worldview, we can cultivate mindfulness and awareness, leading to a more integrated and harmonious life.
