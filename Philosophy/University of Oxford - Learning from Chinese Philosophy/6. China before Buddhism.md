### I. The Early Chinese Dynasties (1045 BCE - 220 CE)

#### A. The Shang Dynasty: Mystery and Transition

The earliest known Chinese dynasty, the Shang, is still shrouded in mystery, with its existence unproven. This period marked a transition from the Neolithic era to the Bronze Age, but little is known about the social, cultural, or philosophical developments of this time.

#### B. The Zhou Dynasty: Social Chaos and Philosophical Debates

The next known dynasty, the Zhou, was characterized by social chaos, which led to philosophical debates as people sought a way to live and organize society. This period, spanning from around 1045 BCE to the end of the Zhou dynasty, is often referred to as the "Hundred Schools of Thought," with various philosophical schools vying for influence.

**Key Concept:** The Hundred Schools of Thought refers to the diverse range of philosophical schools that emerged during this period, including Confucianism, Taoism, Moism, Legalism, the School of Names, and the Yin-Yang school. These schools developed distinct ideas about morality, governance, and the nature of reality.

#### C. The Rise of Western Philosophy

Coincidentally, this was also a time when ancient Greece's great philosophers, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, were laying the foundations of Western philosophy. Despite no known communication between these two cultures during this period, China's intellectual landscape was rich in diversity.

### II. The Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BCE - 220 CE)

#### A. The Qin Dynasty: Centralized Government

The Zhou dynasty eventually gave way to the Qin, which established a centralized government but ultimately failed to last long. The Qin's emphasis on law and order led to a rigid system of governance that stifled intellectual freedom.

**Key Concept:** Legalism was a philosophical school that emerged during this period, emphasizing the importance of strict laws and punishments in maintaining social order.

#### B. The Han Dynasty: Confucianism and the Five Classics

The Han dynasty, which succeeded the Qin, lasted for over 400 years and saw the establishment of Confucianism as an official philosophy of the state. This period also coincided with the rise and peak of the Roman Empire in the West.

**Key Concept:** The Five Classics refer to central texts for Confucian education: the Odes (Classic of Poetry), Documents (Classic of History), Changes (Classic of Changes), Rites (Record of Rights), and Spring and Autumn Annals. These texts would go on to shape Chinese thought and culture for centuries to come.

### III. The Six Dynasties Period (220 - 589 CE)

#### A. Buddhism's Rise in China

As China entered the "Six Dynasties" period, a time of chaos and fragmentation, Buddhism began to gain influence, eventually becoming dominant among intellectuals and common people alike. The Tang dynasty saw Buddhism's dominance reach new heights, influencing Chinese material culture, art, and literature.

**Key Concept:** Neo-Confucianism emerged as a reaction against Buddhism's dominance, emphasizing the importance of Confucian values and virtues in governance and personal life.

#### B. The Development of Neo-Confucianism

The Tang dynasty also saw the development of Neo-Confucianism, which emphasized the importance of moral character and self-cultivation in achieving a harmonious society.

**Key Concept:** Neo-Confucianism is a philosophical school that emerged as a response to Buddhism's influence. It emphasizes the importance of Confucian values such as benevolence, righteousness, and propriety in governance and personal life.

### IV. Key Thinkers and Their Contributions

#### A. Confucius and the Spring and Autumn Annals

Throughout this period, China's intellectual landscape was marked by a vibrant exchange of ideas between various philosophical schools. The likes of Confucius, Laozi, Mencius, and Zhuangzi contributed to this rich intellectual heritage.

**Key Concept:** The Spring and Autumn Annals is an ancient Chinese historical chronicle that has been attributed to Confucius. However, the text as we have it is considered too boring to be the work of a philosopher, leading many to believe that it was not written by Confucius.

#### B. Dongjongshu: Virtue and Governance

Dongjongshu, a prominent thinker in the Han dynasty, emphasized the importance of carefully reading the classics, including the Spring and Autumn Annals, to understand the intentions of the sages who wrote them. He believed that by examining the language and etymology of the text, one could gain insight into the nature of reality and morality.

**Key Concept:** Dongjongshu's thought is characterized by a teleological worldview, where the natural world and morality are deeply intertwined. He believed in the importance of reading omens and calamities as signs from heaven, and that virtues, particularly benevolence and wisdom, were essential for governing well.
