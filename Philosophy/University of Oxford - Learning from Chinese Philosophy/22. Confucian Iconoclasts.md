### I. The Late Ming Dynasty: A Time of Intellectual Revolution
#### A. Challenging Assumptions with Wang Yangming's Ideas

The late Ming dynasty was marked by a significant shift in intellectual thought, particularly among Confucian iconoclasts who questioned the assumptions taken for granted by their contemporaries. One such thinker, influenced by Wang Yangming's ideas on pure knowing, emphasized that moral truths are already present in one's mind and don't require extensive learning or reading. This idea challenged the traditional notion of relying on external authorities, such as Confucian classics, to guide one's understanding.

#### B. Lee Jiru: A Radical Critique of Traditional Authority

Lee Jiru was a prominent thinker who took Wang Yangming's ideas further, questioning the authority of Confucian classics and advocating for a return to one's authentic, childlike naivety. He argued that the six classics, Analects, and Mencius have become nothing more than a "crib sheet" for those belonging to the school of pattern. Lee Jiru believed that true understanding comes from trusting one's genuine mind rather than relying on external authorities.

**Key Concept:** _Pure knowing_ refers to the idea that moral truths are already present in one's mind, as proposed by Wang Yangming. This concept challenges traditional notions of learning and authority.

#### C. Lee Jiru's Views on Women's Equality

Lee Jiru was a pioneer in challenging traditional gender roles, arguing that women are capable of all the same intellectual and moral excellences as men. He drew parallels between this idea and Plato's notion of philosopher kings and queens, suggesting that women can achieve the highest levels of virtue and intellectual achievements.

**Key Concept:** _Intersectionality_ refers to the idea that individuals have multiple identities (e.g., gender, class, race) that intersect and interact with one another. This concept is relevant to Lee Jiru's views on women's equality.

#### D. The Significance of Women's Voices in Chinese History

In traditional China, there existed a collection of four books written by women for other women, explaining what it means to be good ethical people and encouraging education. These works provide valuable insights into the lives and perspectives of Chinese women in the past. However, their views on women's roles may seem old-fashioned or even patriarchal to modern readers.

**Key Concept:** _Feminism_ refers to the social and political movement that advocates for women's rights and equality.

#### E. Early 20th-Century Chinese Feminism

An anthology titled "The Birth of Chinese Feminism" presents early 20th-century Chinese women who defended genuinely feminist views, including Haiyan Jun, whose writings anticipated notions of intersectionality decades before it became a buzzword in feminist thought.

**Key Concept:** _Intersectionality_ (continued) refers to the idea that individuals have multiple identities (e.g., gender, class, race) that intersect and interact with one another. This concept is relevant to Haiyan Jun's views on women's equality.

### II. The Role of Schools in Society
#### A. Huang Zongshi: Critiquing Government Failure

Huang Zongshi critiqued the government's failure to serve the people and instead prioritize the ruler's interests. He argued that true government officials should serve the people, not just their rulers, and that laws should be created to promote order, not just maintain power.

**Key Concept:** _Critical thinking_ refers to the ability to analyze information, evaluate evidence, and form well-supported conclusions. This concept is relevant to Huang Zongshi's views on government accountability.

#### B. The Importance of Critical Thinking in Education

Confucian thinkers like Huang Zum Shi suggest that schools should produce individuals who are willing to question authority, have the character to speak out against wrongdoing, and be able to criticize government policies. This perspective is rooted in historical events, such as the collapse of the Ming dynasty, where rulers failed to listen to criticism and instead prioritized loyalty over accountability.

**Key Concept:** _Dissent_ refers to the act of expressing disagreement or opposition to a particular idea, policy, or authority. This concept is relevant to Huang Zum Shi's views on government accountability.

#### C. The Tension Between Tradition and Critical Thinking

Confucian teachings can be seen as subversive when thinkers like Huang Zum Shi emphasize the right of people to rebel against bad rulers, highlighting the tension between tradition and critical thinking. This idea has been illustrated in recent political events, where officials chose to uphold democracy over loyalty to a leader.

**Key Concept:** _Subversion_ refers to the act of challenging or undermining established authority or norms. This concept is relevant to Huang Zum Shi's views on government accountability.
