### I. The Life and Legacy of Confucius
#### A. Historical Context and Controversy Surrounding Confucius

Confucius, a historical and cultural figure, has been the subject of controversy throughout history. In 2011, a 30-foot bronze statue was unveiled in Tiananmen Square, only to be removed just a month later, reflecting the tension between pro- and anti-Confucian factions within the Chinese government. This dichotomy highlights the complexities surrounding Confucius's figure.

#### B. The Two Extremes: Reverence and Ridicule

Confucius's image is often associated with two extremes: reverence for his wisdom or ridicule as a figure of fun. However, even today, there are people who dislike him, as evident in a Cultural Revolution-era poster depicting him as an evil cowardly backward thinker.

#### C. Confucius's Life and Teachings

Despite this controversy, Confucius has been venerated since ancient times, and one of his followers described him as "the unicorn among animals." Yet, another philosopher from the same era criticized Confucians for being indolent and arrogant. To understand his significance, let us examine his life: born into an aristocratic family but left destitute after his father's death, Confucius worked hard to study and learn from China's ancient traditions.

He eventually became a teacher, attracting students with his learning and virtuous personality. His teachings were compiled in the Analects, which remains one of our best sources for information about him. The Analects contains six major themes: achieving happiness in everyday life, guiding others by virtue rather than force, ritual as a model for human interactions, ethical transformation through learning, reforming the present by reviving the best traditions, and the family as a source of ethics.

### II. Confucianism and Its Key Themes
#### A. Achieving Happiness in Everyday Life

Confucius's ideal of happiness is distinct from the Platonic notion that one must transcend the physical world to achieve true fulfillment. Instead, he believed in bringing the way back to society, where people can enjoy everyday pleasures like going for walks or swimming in rivers.

This idyllic existence is achieved through guiding others by virtue and keeping them in line with ritual, rather than relying on coercive regulations and punishments. Confucius emphasized the importance of learning, which involves studying classics, learning from wise teachers, and thinking critically about what one has learned.

#### B. Guiding Others by Virtue

Confucius stressed that learning must be accompanied by thinking to avoid being lost or in danger. The Analects is a challenging text that requires readers to think for themselves about its meaning and application to their lives.

#### C. Ritual as a Model for Human Interactions

Confucius's approach to tradition was not simply to transmit it but also to innovate, as he saw things in his tradition that others had missed. He was willing to accept changes in ritual or tradition if there was a point to them, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the importance of adapting to changing circumstances while remaining true to one's values and principles.

#### D. The Family as a Source of Ethics

The importance of family in nurturing virtue is another key aspect of Confucianism, as it is through loving and being loved by others that one develops compassion, integrity, and righteousness. Filial piety and respect for elders are considered essential virtues, with Confucius stating that a good society relies on good families.

### III. The Significance of Confucianism Today
#### A. Evolution of Attitudes Towards Confucius

In China, attitudes towards Confucius have evolved significantly, from being seen as an outmoded feudalistic idea during the Cultural Revolution to being recognized as a positive influence on society today. The Chinese government has even honored Confucius with a stamp and established Confucian institutes around the world.

#### B. Confucianism's Enduring Relevance

The current paramount ruler of China, Xi Jinping, has praised Confucianism and stated that even communists can learn from it. As a historian, I believe that Confucianism will continue to thrive for another 2,500 years, inspiring great minds and having a positive influence on the world.

### IV. Reflections on Modern Life and Confucius's Teachings
#### A. The Importance of Humor and Education

The benefits of modern life, such as access to healthcare, housing, and clothing, have allowed people to live longer lives. This is a reminder of the importance of vaccination in reducing childhood mortality rates.

In contrast, ancient texts like Ecclesiastes from the Bible present a more somber view of life, while the Analects of Confucius convey a sense of humor and awareness of human suffering. Confucius was known for his ability to make jokes about himself and others, yet he also emphasized the importance of using one's education to improve the world.

#### B. Finding Joy in Learning and Teaching

His teachings suggest that it is possible to find joy in learning and teaching, even as one ages. This perspective offers valuable advice for us today, reminding us to approach life with a sense of humor and a commitment to making a positive impact on the world.
