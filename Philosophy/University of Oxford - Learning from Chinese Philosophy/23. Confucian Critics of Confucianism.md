### I. Critique of Confucianism in the Qing Dynasty
#### A. Emergence of New Thinkers and Their Influence on Each Other

In the Qing dynasty, a new wave of Confucian thinkers emerged, critiquing earlier interpretations of Confucianism that had developed during the Song and Ming dynasties. Two notable thinkers, Daijun and Zhang, were friends who engaged in a dialogue through correspondence, influencing each other's philosophical ideas. Their critiques aimed to disentangle Confucianism from heterodox teachings like Taoism and Buddhism.

#### B. Daijun's Critique of Pattern

Daijun was particularly critical of the way Song dynasty Confucians had interpreted the concept of "pattern" (, pƒÅi). He argued that these later interpretations had been influenced by earlier Buddhist conceptions of pattern as a metaphysical entity. In contrast, Daijun emphasized that pattern simply meant good order and the ability to distinguish between things. He drew on examples from classical texts, such as the Mean and the Record of Music, to illustrate his point.

Daijun noted that the term "pattern" rarely occurs in the Six Classics or other ancient writings, but is frequently invoked by later Confucians. His critique aimed to restore a more nuanced understanding of pattern as good order, achieved through the regulation of desires and the consideration of essential feelings. Daijun applied this idea to a famous passage in the Mangza, where compassion and benevolence are not seen as metaphysical entities, but rather as the correct functioning of the faculty of understanding.

#### C. Daijun's Philosophy on Desires and Emotions

Daijun's philosophy emphasized the importance of distinguishing between what comes from pattern (good order) and what comes from desire. He argued that desires should be regulated so that they neither exceed nor fall short of essential feelings. The Confucian virtues of righteousness, wisdom, and ritual propriety are rooted in emotional reactions that arise from human desires.

These emotions, such as shame or approval, are a natural response to satisfying our needs for comfort, food, drink, and intimacy. Daijun's approach is exemplified by the ancient Confucians' understanding of these desires as essential to being human. They believed that the key to virtuous living lay in responding appropriately to the needs and problems of one's historical situation, rather than trying to follow abstract models or rules.

#### D. Zhang's Perspective on the Classics

Zhang Chung argued that the Confucian classics should be read as historical works that record how sages responded to particular needs, rather than as timeless prescriptions for behavior. According to Zhang, the way (the natural transformations of the world and history) cannot be fully described in words or abstracted from its material manifestations.

The Confucian classics, including the six classics and four books, are records of how sages responded to their historical situations, not descriptions of a universal way that applies to all people at all times. By understanding this distinction, we can learn from the classics without trying to repeat or copy what was done in the past, but rather respond appropriately to our own unique circumstances.

#### E. Historical Context and Adaptation

Zhang's ideas align with the perspective of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who historicized rationality and morality, arguing that what is rational or moral depends on the historical context. Zhang believed that we must consider the specific needs and circumstances of each era when applying the principles of these classic texts.

A contemporary follower of Zhang would argue that morality and rationality are historically conditioned, and that we must adapt our understanding to fit the needs of each era. This approach is distinct from the social contract theory of thinkers like John Locke, who believed in universal natural rights that remain unchanged over time.
