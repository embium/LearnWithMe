### I. Wang Yangming: A Confucian Philosopher in Later Tradition
#### A. Life and Influences

Wang Yangming (1472-1529) was one of China's most influential philosophers, whose teachings were shaped by his experiences as a successful government official and general. His life took a significant turn when he was punished for criticizing an influential eunuch, leading him to a realization that would change his philosophy forever.

Wang's mentor, Juxi, had advocated a more holistic approach to Confucianism, emphasizing the unity of all things. However, Wang took this idea further, arguing that true understanding can only be achieved by looking inward and accessing one's own mind. This emphasis on individual moral cultivation was revolutionary for its time, challenging the traditional focus on rote memorization and external authority.

#### B. Key Concepts: Pattern (Li) and Pure Knowing

Wang Yangming's philosophy centered around two key concepts: **pattern** or **li**, which he believed was fully present in one's own mind, and **pure knowing**, which emphasized the innate capacity for moral understanding.

*   **Pattern (Li)**: Wang argued that this pattern is not something external but rather an inherent part of one's own mind. It represents the unity of all things and serves as a guide for moral cultivation.
*   **Pure Knowing**: This concept highlights the idea that humans have an innate capacity for moral understanding, which is not acquired through study or reflection but rather through exercising one's existing capabilities.

#### C. Critique of Traditional Examination System

Wang Yangming critiqued the traditional examination system, which he saw as perpetuating a dry scholasticism and careerism rather than promoting genuine moral cultivation. He believed that this system stifled individual growth and creativity, leading to a focus on external authority rather than internal understanding.

#### D. Emphasis on Unity with All Things

Wang's philosophy emphasized the unity of all things, arguing that humans form a single body with heaven, earth, and all creatures. This interconnectedness is reflected in our reactions to the world around us, which serve as evidence of our inherent capacity for moral understanding.

*   **Interconnectedness**: Wang cited various examples, including stories about a king feeling sorry for an ox being led to slaughter and someone thinking of grass growing in front of their window as themselves. These anecdotes illustrate that humans form one body with all things.
*   **Selfish Desires**: Wang argued that selfish desires obscure our true nature and ability to form one body with heaven, earth, and all things. To overcome this, we must recognize that being a good person is not about achieving lofty goals or transcending the world but rather about overcoming selfishness and caring for others.

#### E. The Way of Great Learning

Wang Yangming's philosophy emphasized the importance of getting rid of selfish desires to achieve true understanding and moral cultivation. This means recognizing that our ultimate good lies within our own mind and that by overcoming selfishness, we can spontaneously be compassionate towards all beings.

*   **The Ultimate Good**: Wang argued that the ultimate good is not something external but rather an inherent part of one's own mind.
*   **Compassion and Kindness**: He believed that even petty people can exhibit compassion and kindness when they see harm or suffering, demonstrating their inherent capacity for moral understanding.
