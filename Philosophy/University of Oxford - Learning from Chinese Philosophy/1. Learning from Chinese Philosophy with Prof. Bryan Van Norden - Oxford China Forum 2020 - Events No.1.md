### I. The Oxford China Forum: Facilitating Academic Discussions on China
#### A. Introduction to the Event

The Oxford China Forum is a student-run organization affiliated with the Oxford China Senator that aims to facilitate academic discussions on topics related to China. This event marks their first online session this term, featuring Professor Van Norden from South College USA and Wilhelm University China. As an expert in Chinese philosophy, he has edited over 10 texts and his translations are considered authoritative in the Western world.

#### B. The Presentation: "The Scarcity of Doctoral Programs in Philosophy"

Professor Van Norden's presentation will last about 45 minutes, followed by a Q&A session. He highlights the scarcity of doctoral programs in philosophy that offer specialization in Chinese philosophy, with only around 12 programs out of approximately 120 in the US. He argues that this is due to a lack of understanding and recognition of Chinese philosophy as a legitimate field of study, rather than any inherent flaws in its methodology or content.

#### C. Historical Context: The Exclusion of Non-Western Philosophies

Professor Van Norden critiques the historical exclusion of non-Western philosophies from the canon, which has been perpetuated through influential thinkers like Immanuel Kant. He references various examples, including the recognition of Confucius' teachings on marriage and family values in Western philosophical traditions.

#### D. The Impact of Institutional Racism

Despite this, many contemporary philosophy departments continue to neglect or dismiss Chinese philosophy, perpetuating institutional racism. Professor Van Norden argues that this phenomenon is rooted in historical racism and has significant implications for the field of philosophy as a whole.

### II. Key Concepts in Chinese Philosophy
#### A. Maudza: Consequentialism and Impartial Caring

Maudza was an ancient Chinese philosopher who advocated a universal consequentialist approach that prioritizes maximizing wealth, populousness, and social order. His consequentialism emphasizes impartial caring, where one should prioritize the well-being of everyone equally, rather than showing partiality towards friends or family.

#### B. Yangju: Ethical Egoism

Yangju challenged Maudza's ideas with a theory of ethical egoism, arguing that human nature is purely self-interested and that people should prioritize their own desires over societal expectations.

#### C. Mangza: Virtue Ethics

Mangza responded to Yangju's ideas with a virtue ethicist approach, arguing that humans have innate dispositions towards virtues such as benevolence and righteousness, which can be cultivated through practice and education.

### III. The Concept of "Sprouts" in Chinese Thought
#### A. Zhuangzi: Skepticism and Relativism

Zhuangzi presented arguments for skepticism, relativism, and pluralism, undermining systematic accounts of truth and reality. His writings are characterized as therapeutic rather than systematic, aiming to free up one's mind from attachment to particular views.

#### B. The Challenge of Discerning Between True and False

The concept of "sprouts" in Chinese thought refers to the cultivation of virtues and moral inclinations. However, the question arises as to how one can identify these sprouts and distinguish them from weeds or vices. This is illustrated by a story about a snake in a swamp, where the guide points out a snake that cannot be seen.

#### C. The Regress Argument

Zhuangzi's argument suggests that morality is not an objective fact, but rather something dependent on individual perspectives and contexts. He uses the example of indexical terms, such as "this" and "that," which can have different meanings depending on who is using them.

### IV. The Concept of "The Way" (Dao) in Chinese Philosophy
#### A. Laozi: Cosmogonic Principle

The concept of "the way" (dao) is a central idea in Chinese philosophy, referring to the right way to live or organize society. However, its meaning can be subjective and context-dependent.

#### B. The Dao De Jing

In chapter 25 of the Dao De Jing, attributed to Laozi, the term dao is used to describe a cosmogonic principle that gives birth to the universe.

### V. Implications for Modern Philosophical Issues
#### A. Virtue Ethics in Confucianism

The ethical cultivation literature in Confucianism offers a rich and intuitive account of virtue ethics that is distinct from Plato's list of cardinal virtues.

#### B. Huayan Buddhism: The Non-Existence of Individual Substances

Huayan Buddhism presents a powerful argument against the existence of individual substances, which has implications for contemporary debates about the nature of objects and their properties.

### VI. Conclusion
Studying Chinese thought can provide valuable insights into the human condition and our place in the world, particularly as we navigate an increasingly multicultural society.
