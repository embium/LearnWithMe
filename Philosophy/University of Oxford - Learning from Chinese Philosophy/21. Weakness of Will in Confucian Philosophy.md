### I. Understanding a Philosopher's Metaphysics
#### A. The Distinction Between Genuine Knowledge and Common Knowledge

The concept of genuine knowledge versus common knowledge is crucial to understanding a philosopher's perspective on human nature and decision-making. Knowing something intellectually does not necessarily translate to true understanding or action. For instance, a farmer who had been mauled by a tiger exemplifies genuine knowledge, as his experience and emotional response were deeply personal and intuitive. In contrast, common knowledge is merely intellectual awareness without practical application.

This distinction has significant implications for the problem of weakness of will, where individuals know what is right but fail to act accordingly. A philosopher's metaphysics can provide insight into this issue, as it may influence their understanding of human nature and the complexities of decision-making.

#### B. The Role of Metaphysics in Understanding Human Nature

A philosopher's metaphysics can inform their perspective on human nature and decision-making. For example, Jushi's metaphysics posits that everything shares a common pattern, which can be obscured by individual differences in chi. This perspective can emphasize the importance of clarifying one's chi to reveal the underlying pattern.

The concept of enlightened virtue is central to this idea, representing the complete pattern within oneself that needs to be cultivated through education and self-reflection. Understanding a philosopher's metaphysics can provide a deeper appreciation for their perspective on human nature and the complexities of decision-making.

#### C. The Unity of Knowing and Acting in Ethics

In classical Chinese thought, the concept of loving a lovely sight and hating a hateful odor has multiple meanings, including lust or erotic desire. This idea is parallel to the notion that ethical perception and motivation should be inseparable. When we hate a bad odor, our perception of it as foul is inextricably linked with our revulsion, motivating us to avoid it.

Similarly, when we love a lovely sight, our perception of it as appealing is tied to our attraction, driving us towards it. This unity of knowing and acting is central to the teachings of Confucian philosophers like Ju Xi and Wang Yang Ming.

#### D. The Implications for Moral Development

The distinction between knowing and acting has significant implications for how we approach ethics and moral development. While Ju Xi views knowledge of good and evil as a precursor to correct action, requiring cultivation and effort, Wang Yang Ming believes that knowing and acting are inherently united, with knowledge of good already implying love for it and knowledge of bad already implying hatred for it.

This perspective highlights the importance of integrating knowledge and action in our pursuit of virtue. By understanding a philosopher's metaphysics and their perspective on human nature, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of decision-making and the importance of cultivating enlightened virtue through education and self-reflection.
