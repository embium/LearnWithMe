### I. The Confucian Commentarial Tradition
#### A. Overview of the Confucian Curriculum

The Confucian commentarial tradition is a pattern observed in many civilizations, where classic texts are interpreted and applied to new situations. This tradition involves the formation of seminal texts that shape the later course of civilization, followed by a period of philosophical commentary on these classics. In ancient times, classic texts were often unclear or semi-mythical in origin but provided deep insight into the nature of the world.

In China, the Confucian curriculum coalesced around the Five Classics during the Han Dynasty: the Odes, Documents, Classic of Changes (I Ching), Rites, and Spring and Autumn Annals. These texts were considered foundational to understanding morality and governance. The Neo-Confucian movement later emphasized the Four Books: the Analytics, Great Learning, Mean, and Mencius.

#### B. Key Concepts in Confucian Thought

*   **Enlightened Virtue**: Central to Confucian thought, this concept refers to a state of moral perfection that contains the entire moral pattern of the universe.
*   **Qi**: A vital energy or life force that flows through all living things, influencing individual endowments and human desires.
*   **Chi**: A term used in conjunction with qi to describe the web of interconnections between everything in the universe.

#### C. The Process of Ethical Cultivation

Through education and self-cultivation, individuals can clarify their chi and come to see the pattern more clearly. This process involves refining one's character by:

*   **Treating Elders as Elders**: A way to treat the whole world with compassion by starting from what is clear and extending to what is not.
*   **Extending Compassion**: Recognizing common qi among family members and extending compassion to all humans, eventually reaching out to animals.

#### D. The Concept of "Beginning" or "Sprout"

This idea refers to the initial manifestation of virtuous nature within oneself. Human beings are born with a capacity for virtue that needs to be cultivated like a sprouting plant. According to Confucius, natures are close to one another but by practice they become far apart from one another.

#### E. The Significance of Pattern and Qi

The concept of pattern describes a web of interconnections between everything in the universe, where each thing reflects every other thing. This idea is often contrasted with the distinction between descriptive and prescriptive claims, which holds that there's a gap between how things are and how they ought to be.

However, many philosophers argue that this dichotomy is problematic, and pre-modern thinkers, including Confucians, don't see it as a clear-cut distinction. Instead, they view pattern as both descriptive and normative, encompassing the relationships between individuals and their obligations to one another.

The notion of qi combines with pattern to do justice to the Buddhist idea that everything is interrelated while also acknowledging individuality and special obligations. This understanding can be applied in everyday life by recognizing the commonality of pattern among people, such as treating others with respect and compassion because they share a common humanity.
