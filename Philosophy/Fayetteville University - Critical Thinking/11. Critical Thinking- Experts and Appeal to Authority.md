### I. Establishing Expertise
#### A. The Importance of Expertise in Modern Society

In today's world, we often rely on experts for guidance and decision-making. However, not all individuals who claim to be experts possess the necessary qualifications or experience. To determine whether someone is an expert, it's essential to look beyond their credentials and examine their actual accomplishments.

#### B. The Five Key Factors of Expertise

There are five key factors that contribute to establishing expertise: education, experience, accomplishments, reputation, and positions of authority.

*   **Education**: This encompasses formal degrees from established institutions, as well as certifications and diplomas from reputable organizations.
*   **Experience**: Relevant work or practice in a specific field is crucial, with a focus on the quality and quantity of experience.
*   **Accomplishments**: Tangible results, such as publications, awards, and successful projects, demonstrate an individual's expertise.
*   **Reputation**: Built through peer recognition and respect within one's field, reputation is an essential factor in establishing credibility.
*   **Positions of Authority**: While positions of authority can indicate expertise, they should not be taken solely as a sign of it.

#### C. Evaluating Expertise

Evaluating an expert requires considering these factors in conjunction with the individual's actual track record of achievements. As students at FSU, your training is not just about earning a degree, but also about becoming an expert in your chosen field.

When evaluating arguments from authority, look for characteristics like experience, education, accomplishments, reputation, and position. If experts disagree, don't simply choose one side; instead, consider their arguments, seek additional opinions, and withhold judgment until you have a good reason to believe something.

### III. Developing Critical Thinking Skills
