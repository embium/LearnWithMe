### I. Complex Arguments
#### A. Introduction to Chain and Network Arguments

Complex arguments involve multiple premises and conclusions that are connected in a chain or network-like structure. This type of reasoning is similar to how we reason in everyday life, where we often need to provide further support for our claims when challenged by others. Critical thinking involves being able to go both forward and backward with an argument, providing reasons for why we believe something and supporting those reasons with evidence.

#### B. Understanding the Structure of Complex Arguments

Complex arguments can involve multiple conclusions that serve as premises for other arguments, making them more nuanced and sophisticated. This is particularly relevant in academic writing, where research papers often involve complex chains of reasoning. By understanding how to structure and analyze these arguments, we can develop our critical thinking skills and become more effective communicators.

**Example:** If students were to write a letter to the chancellor about tuition increases, they would need to identify their main claim (e.g., "stop raising tuition") and support it with various premises, such as:

* The impact on student affordability
* The value of education
* The university's responsibility to its clients

By diagramming these arguments and imposing structure on them, we can better understand how to present our claims in a clear and compelling way.

#### C. Real-World Applications of Complex Arguments

Complex arguments are essential not only for academic writing but also for effective communication in various fields, such as:

* Business: Convincing stakeholders to adopt new ideas or policies
* Counseling: Helping clients navigate complex issues and make informed decisions
* Criminal Justice: Presenting evidence and arguments in court cases
* Politics: Framing proposals and addressing concerns from different perspectives

**Example:** In politics, changes often require convincing people to adopt new ideas. A common tactic is to frame a proposal as beneficial for education, such as using lottery funds specifically for educational purposes. However, critics argue that lotteries disproportionately affect the poor and can be seen as an additional tax on them.

#### D. Examining Implicit Assumptions in Complex Arguments

When arguing about students being unhappy, it's essential to consider the implicit assumptions behind this claim. For instance:

* If students are paying your salary, their feelings become important, and it's implied that it's your job to make them happy or at least content
* This assumption can be challenged by considering alternative perspectives, such as in institutions where making people unhappy is seen as a desirable outcome

By examining the relationships between claims and assumptions, one can see how arguments can shift from premises to conclusions depending on the context.

#### E. Recognizing Shared Knowledge and Background Information

In real-life arguments, we often assume shared knowledge or background information, such as:

* The consequences of snowfall on class schedules
* The impact of a particular policy on a specific community

Recognizing these implicit assumptions and considering alternative perspectives is crucial for effective argumentation and critical thinking.
