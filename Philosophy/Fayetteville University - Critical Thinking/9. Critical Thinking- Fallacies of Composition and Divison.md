### I. Composition Fallacies
#### A. Overview
Composition fallacies occur when an argument is made from the parts to the whole or vice versa, often with incorrect assumptions. This type of reasoning can be misleading because it fails to consider the unique characteristics and relationships within a group.

#### B. Types of Composition Fallacies

- **Fallacy of Division**: This occurs when we assume that if each part has a certain quality, then the whole must also have that quality.
  - Example: Assuming that since every player on the Green Bay Packers has been in the league for many years, the team itself has been around for as long. However, the team was actually established in 1919, while some players may have joined much later.

- **Fallacy of Composition**: This occurs when we assume that because each part shares a certain quality, the whole group must also share that quality.
  - Example: Assuming that since individual secretaries and doctors have certain qualities, the whole group of secretaries makes more than the whole group of doctors. However, this may not be true if there are significant differences in salary scales or job responsibilities.

#### C. Everyday Examples

- **Cooking**: Just because individual ingredients taste good by themselves, it doesn't mean the final dish will also taste good.
  - This highlights how composition fallacies can occur even in everyday situations where we might assume that combining parts with certain qualities will result in a whole with those same qualities.

- **Sports Teams**: Having star players doesn't guarantee success; teamwork and practice are essential for a team's overall performance.
  - This example illustrates how the fallacy of division can be applied to teams, emphasizing the importance of considering the whole when evaluating its parts.

#### D. Analogies

- **Dividing a Pie**: Just because each slice has a certain quality (e.g., being delicious), it doesn't mean the entire pie shares that same quality.
  - This analogy helps illustrate how composition fallacies can occur even in situations where we might assume that combining parts with certain qualities will result in a whole with those same qualities.

- **Composing Music**: Not all notes or melodies necessarily share the same quality as the final composition; harmony and arrangement are crucial for creating a cohesive piece.
  - This example highlights how composition fallacies can be applied to creative endeavors, emphasizing the importance of considering the whole when evaluating its parts.

#### E. Real-World Applications

- **Teams**: Just because every individual player on a team is skilled, it doesn't mean the entire team is equally talented.
  - This emphasizes the need to consider the unique characteristics and relationships within a group when making assumptions about its overall quality or performance.

- **Geographical Locations**: Just because every cell in our body is replaced over time, it doesn't mean the entire body is only seven years old.
  - This example illustrates how composition fallacies can be applied to various contexts, including geographical locations and even companies, highlighting the importance of considering the whole when evaluating its parts.

#### F. Conclusion
Composition fallacies are a type of reasoning error that occurs when we make assumptions about groups based on their individual parts. By understanding these fallacies and their applications in everyday life, we can develop more accurate and nuanced thinking skills, ultimately leading to better decision-making and problem-solving abilities.
