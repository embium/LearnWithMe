### I. Introduction to the New Testament Course
#### A. Understanding the Significance of Studying the New Testament

The New Testament course is designed to introduce students to the history and literature of early Christianity, covering the first century of its development. It's essential to approach this subject with a clear understanding of why one wants to study the New Testament. This isn't merely about being Christian or believing in its scripture; rather, it's about exploring a foundational document for Western civilization that has had a profound impact on art, literature, and culture.

**Key Concept:** _Western Civilization_ refers to the cultural, social, and philosophical developments of Europe and North America from ancient times to the present day. The New Testament is considered a foundational text in this context because it has shaped the values, beliefs, and practices of Western societies.

Many people may confuse or misinterpret various concepts related to the Bible, such as the Immaculate Conception and the doctrine of the Trinity. These ideas are not necessarily found in the New Testament but have become part of Christian tradition over time. It's crucial to approach the text from an outside perspective, setting aside preconceptions about its significance.

#### B. Common Misconceptions About the Bible

A quiz on common misconceptions about the Bible reveals that many people:

* Confuse the Immaculate Conception with a New Testament concept (it actually refers to a Catholic doctrine)
* Misinterpret the doctrine of the Trinity, which is not explicitly stated in the New Testament
* Believe that the New Testament is solely about being Christian or believing in its scripture

These misconceptions highlight the importance of understanding the context and historical development of early Christianity.

### II. Exploring Early Christianity
#### A. The Complexity and Diversity of Early Christianity

The New Testament presents a diverse collection of documents, written over a period of time, with varying points of view, situations, and theologies. These texts often use confusing in-house language that requires guidance from historians and experts to interpret.

**Key Concept:** _Historical-Critical Approach_ refers to a method of analyzing ancient texts by considering their historical context, literary structure, and theological themes.

To better understand early Christianity, it's helpful to imagine what these groups would have looked like to outsiders. For example, a seamstress living in Corinth in 56 AD might have seen early Christian meetings as strange gatherings, with participants using terms like "comrade" and engaging in practices that seemed bizarre or even immoral.

#### B. The Language of Early Christianity

The language used by early Christians was sometimes common Greek, but often sounded strange and in-house to outsiders. This linguistic complexity is a key aspect of understanding the New Testament's diverse literature.

### III. Key Themes and Issues
#### A. Jesus: Divine, Human, or Both?

The course will explore how Jesus was perceived as divine, human, or a combination of both by early Christians. This complex issue has significant implications for understanding the development of Christian theology.

**Key Concept:** _Christology_ refers to the study of the nature and person of Jesus Christ in Christian theology.

#### B. Early Christianity's Social Issues

The course will also examine how early Christians dealt with social issues such as:

* Women: their roles, rights, and treatment within early Christian communities
* Slaves: their status, treatment, and potential for freedom within early Christian contexts
* Other social issues: the impact of early Christianity on various aspects of ancient society

### IV. Analyzing the New Testament
#### A. The Historical-Critical Approach

The course will use the historical-critical approach to analyze the New Testament, focusing on the methods of exegesis and historical study.

**Key Concept:** _Exegesis_ refers to the process of interpreting a text in its original context, taking into account its language, culture, and historical background.

#### B. Debates Over Translation, Canonization, and Legacy

Through discussions, readings, and assignments, we'll delve into the complexities of early Christianity, including debates over:

* Translation: how to accurately translate ancient texts for modern readers
* Canonization: the process of selecting which texts to include in the New Testament canon
* Legacy: the impact of these texts on later literature and culture

By exploring these themes and issues, students will gain a deeper understanding of early Christianity's complexities and diversity.
