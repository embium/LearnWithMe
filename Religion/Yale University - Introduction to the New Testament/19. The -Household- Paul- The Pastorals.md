### I. The Pastoral Epistles: A Window into Early Christianity
#### A. Overview and Context

The pastoral epistles (1st and 2nd Timothy and Titus) are a collection of letters attributed to Paul but widely believed by scholars to be pseudonymous, meaning they were written in his name by someone else. These letters present a distinct writing style different from the seven letters that scholars agree Paul actually wrote, suggesting they presuppose a later stage in early Christianity with differing theology and church structure.

#### B. Theological and Ecclesiastical Views

The pastoral epistles reflect a more traditional Roman or Greco-Roman view on household, marriage, slavery, family, and women's roles. In contrast to the Acts of Paul and Thecla, which presents Paul as opposing these values, preaching against marriage, sex, and the Roman household.

- **Key Points:**

  - The pastoral epistles emphasize family, marriage, and procreation.
  - They oppose asceticism and the teaching of resurrection before its time.
  - The church is viewed as a household with men holding positions of authority (bishops, elders, deacons).
  - Women are expected to be in subordinate roles, silent in church, and not hold leadership or teaching authority over men.

#### C. Historical Context

The pastoral epistles are likely from the second century, possibly written around the middle of that century. This timing is significant because Marcion, a heretic who created his own canon of New Testament books, did not include these letters in his list, suggesting they may have been less circulated at that time.

#### D. Theological and Social Implications

The pastoral epistles reveal a distinct split between different kinds of Christianity in the early Christian communities. One group emphasizes family, marriage, and procreation, opposing asceticism and the teaching of resurrection before its time. This approach aims to bring Paul's teachings in line with the second-century Christian environment, restructuring the church according to a household model.

- **Key Points:**

  - The office of widows is established, with women being registered and receiving financial support from the churches.
  - Women are expected to be silent in church and not hold leadership or teaching authority over men.
  - This hierarchical structure intensifies compared to earlier Christian texts like Colossians and Ephesians.

#### E. Conclusion

The pastoral epistles provide a unique window into early Christianity, highlighting the diversity of views on household, marriage, slavery, family, and women's roles. The contrast between these letters and the Acts of Paul and Thecla demonstrates how Paul was used to support radically different interpretations, underscoring the complexity and evolution of Christian theology in its early development.

### II. Paul's Views on Household, Marriage, and Women
#### A. Overview

The pastoral epistles present a pro-family, anti-woman stance compared to the Acts of Paul and Thecla's anti-family, pro-woman view. This section will examine Paul's views on household, marriage, and women in these letters.

#### B. Pro-Family Stance

- **Key Points:**

  - The pastoral epistles emphasize family, marriage, and procreation.
  - They present a traditional Roman or Greco-Roman view on household and family roles.
  - Women are expected to be in subordinate roles within the church and society.

#### C. Anti-Woman Stance

- **Key Points:**

  - The pastoral epistles restrict women's roles in the church, requiring them to be silent and not hold leadership or teaching authority over men.
  - The office of widows is established, with women being registered and receiving financial support from the churches.
  - This approach aims to pull women back into their submissive place through the creation of new roles.

#### D. Conclusion

The pastoral epistles provide a unique perspective on Paul's views on household, marriage, and women. The contrast between these letters and other early Christian texts highlights the diversity of interpretations within Christianity in its early development.

### III. Early Christian Communities: Diversity and Split
#### A. Overview

The second-century Christian texts reveal a distinct split between different kinds of Christianity. One group emphasizes family, marriage, and procreation, opposing asceticism and the teaching of resurrection before its time.

#### B. The Church as a Household

- **Key Points:**

  - The church is viewed as a household with men holding positions of authority (bishops, elders, deacons).
  - Women are expected to be in subordinate roles within the church.
  - This hierarchical structure intensifies compared to earlier Christian texts.

#### C. Conclusion

The early Christian communities demonstrate diversity and split, reflecting different views on household, marriage, slavery, family, and women's roles. The pastoral epistles provide a unique window into this complex period of Christianity's development.
