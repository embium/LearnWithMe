### I. The Gospel of John: A Unique Narrative Structure and Style
#### A. Overview of the Gospel's Distinctiveness

The Gospel of John stands out from the other three gospels in its narrative structure, style, and theological themes. From the beginning, it presents a unique world, distinct from the synoptic gospels, with repetitive phrases and words like "light" and "darkness." The prologue sets the tone for the rest of the gospel, introducing major themes such as Jesus' pre-existence, divinity, and role in the cosmos.

#### B. Key Features of John's Narrative Structure

- **Overlapping Ministries**: In contrast to the synoptics, John's narrative structure is characterized by an overlap between Jesus' and John the Baptist's ministries, with both figures active at the same time.
- **Multiple Passovers**: The Gospel of John also differs from the other gospels in its depiction of Jesus' ministry, which spans multiple Passovers, rather than a single year-long period.
- **Distinctive Last Supper, Arrest, Trial, Crucifixion, and Resurrection Narratives**: These events are distinct from those found in the synoptics.

#### C. The Beloved Disciple: A Unique Character

The Gospel of John features the Beloved Disciple, a character who does not exist in the other gospels, and whose identity remains unknown. This unique character adds to the gospel's distinctive narrative structure and style.

### II. Themes and Interpretations
#### A. Seeing and Knowing: The Relationship Between Faith and Sight

Jesus says that those who come to him when he is lifted up will be lifted up, indicating a connection between his own exaltation and the salvation of others. However, this theme is complicated by the fact that Jesus also says blessed are those who believe without seeing, suggesting that faith can exist independently of physical sight.

- **The Blind Man in Chapter 9**: The story of the blind man in chapter 9 serves as an allegory for the conflict between Jesus' church and the synagogue, highlighting the sectarianism that drives the narrative.
- **Implications for Faith and Sight**: This tension highlights the complexities of faith and sight, emphasizing the importance of faith over physical sight.

#### B. Christology: The Gospel's Presentation of Jesus

The Gospel of John presents Jesus as equal to God the Father, a claim that is radical and sets him apart from other gospels.

- **Jesus' Divinity**: This is evident in chapter 5, where Jesus says he can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the Father doing, implying a level of divinity that is unparalleled in other accounts.
- **Editorializing Phrases**: The Gospel writer editorializes in this passage, inserting phrases like "thereby making himself equal to God" to emphasize their interpretation of Jesus' nature.
- **The Tetragrammaton**: In chapter 8, Jesus claims to be I am, a phrase that is equivalent to the tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of God. This claim is radical and sets Jesus apart from other gospels.

#### C. Theological Implications

This emphasis on Jesus' divinity continues throughout the Gospel, culminating in chapter 8, where Jesus claims to be I am. This claim has significant theological implications, making it no wonder that the Jews tried to stone him.

- **Radical Claim**: Jesus' claim to be equal to God is a radical statement that sets him apart from other gospels.
- **Theological Significance**: The Gospel of John's presentation of Jesus as divine has significant theological implications for early Christian tradition.
