### I. The Nature and Purpose of the Gospel of Luke and Acts
#### A. Historical vs. Creative Texts

The Gospel of Luke and Acts are not historical documents in the classical sense, but rather creative texts with theological and thematic purposes. This means that the author of Luke-Acts has taken existing sources from before him, including oral and written accounts, to construct his narrative. The artificial construction of certain sections, such as the journey to Jerusalem in Luke, demonstrates this approach. For example, material from Mark and Q is rearranged to fit a specific theme.

#### B. Sources and Composition

The author of Acts uses sources to make his own points, often by manipulating existing narratives. This can be seen in the story of Stephen in Acts 6-7, where his speech appears to be a false accusation against him, but actually reflects his own views on the law and the temple. The author's intention is to emphasize a prophetic tradition that criticizes the Jerusalem Temple, while also distancing God from the law by attributing it to angels rather than God directly.

#### C. Thematic and Theological Concerns

Luke-Acts presents two different forms of early Christianity: one that views the law as given by angels and demoted, and another that sees the temple as a sign of God's covenant with Israel. The author carefully constructs his sources to make these points, including Jesus' similarity to prophets like Elijah and Elisha, and the rejection of prophets leading to the message going out to other corners of the earth.

### II. Portrayal of Prophets and Jewish Law
#### A. Jesus as a Good Jewish Boy

Luke is concerned to show Jesus as a good Jewish boy, emphasizing his family's righteousness and connection to the priestly order of Zechariah. This portrayal highlights Jesus' adherence to Jewish law and tradition.

#### B. The Holy Family and Jewish Customs

The Gospel of Luke depicts the Holy Family, including Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, observing Jewish customs such as circumcision and presenting Jesus at the temple. This emphasizes their commitment to Jewish law and tradition.

#### C. Gentile Followers and Ethical Principles

In contrast, Gentile followers of Jesus, like Paul, are not required to keep the Jewish law. Luke's view is that the law is good for Jews but not binding on Gentiles, who will follow other ethical principles instead.

### III. Diversity within Early Christianity
#### A. Different Views on the Law

Luke's emphasis on the Jewish law and tradition highlights the diversity within early Christianity, with different groups holding varying views on the law and its significance for followers of Jesus. This perspective differs from Matthew and Mark, which emphasize Jesus' fulfillment or modification of the Jewish law.

#### B. Prophets as Martyrs

The theme of prophets as martyrs continues in Acts, where Paul is portrayed as an innocent martyr, proclaiming his innocence to various rulers and leaders. This narrative reinforces Luke's emphasis on the importance of prophetic tradition and the rejection of the Jerusalem Temple.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. Theological and Thematic Narrative

The Gospel of Luke and Acts present a theological and thematic narrative that should not be taken as historical fact. Instead, they offer insights into the diverse perspectives within early Christianity, highlighting the significance of prophetic tradition and the role of Jewish law in shaping the faith.

#### B. Implications for Understanding Early Christianity

This understanding has implications for how we approach the study of early Christianity, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple perspectives and the diversity of views on key issues such as the law and its significance for followers of Jesus.
