### I. The Book of Revelation: A Heavily Anti-Roman View
#### A. Historical Context and Authorship

The book of Revelation presents a unique perspective on Christianity, one that is heavily anti-Roman in its view. The author likely wrote to counter the kind of Christianity represented by Paul's churches, which were more accommodating to Roman power. This author may have been someone who came from Palestine and lived through the Jewish war of 70, developing a strong hatred for the Romans.

The book's politics are distinct from Paul's view in Romans 13, where the Roman governor is presented as God's servant to punish wrongdoing. In contrast, the author of Revelation sees the Roman Empire as a force to be feared and opposed. This anti-Roman sentiment is also reflected in the letters of 2nd Thessalonians and 1st Peter, although the latter may have been written by someone who was more accommodating to Roman power.

#### B. The Author's Politics and Perspective

The author of Revelation sees Rome as a wholeheartedly negative thing, unlike the view presented in Romans 13. This is reflected in the book's apocalyptic fervor, where Christianity is portrayed as a force against Roman oppression. In contrast, the letters attributed to Peter present a conservative, accommodationist approach to Christianity.

*   The author of Revelation wants followers of Jesus to hate Rome as much as he does.
*   He sees the Roman Empire as a force to be feared and opposed.
*   This view is distinct from that presented in Romans 13, where the Roman governor is seen as God's servant to punish wrongdoing.

#### C. Comparison with Other New Testament Letters

The book of Revelation can be compared with other New Testament letters, such as 2nd Thessalonians and 1st Peter. While these letters also present an anti-Roman view, they differ in their politics and perspective.

*   The author of 2nd Thessalonians seems to have imagined a scenario where the Roman Empire would be removed from being a geopolitical force, allowing for the beginning of the end time schedule to kick in.
*   This view is distinct from that presented in Revelation, which sees Rome as a wholeheartedly negative thing.
*   The letter attributed to Peter presents a later stage of Christian development, with theological notions that surpass the primitive era of early Christianity.

#### D. Conclusion

The book of Revelation presents a unique perspective on Christianity, one that is heavily anti-Roman in its view. The author likely wrote to counter the kind of Christianity represented by Paul's churches, which were more accommodating to Roman power.
