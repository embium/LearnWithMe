### I. The Galatian Crisis and Paul's Response
#### A. Background and Context

Paul founded house churches in Galatia, a region of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), likely during his first missionary journey. These Gentile churches had no record of contact with Jewish communities, and Paul's letter to the Galatians does not address Jews directly. Instead, it responds to traveling teachers who may have been Jewish followers of Jesus or Gentiles who became law-observant after converting.

#### B. The Issue at Hand: Law Observance and Justification

The issue in Galatia was whether keeping kosher and being circumcised were necessary for full citizenship in the group. Paul vehemently disagreed, writing that justification comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works of the law (Galatians 2:15-21). He emphasizes his independence from Jewish leadership and argues that the law does not justify, citing Abraham's justification by faith before circumcision.

#### C. Key Themes and Allegories

Paul separates faith and law, stating that the law was added to increase transgressions (Galatians 3:19). He equates keeping the Jewish law with serving elemental spirits of the universe, which he believes are demonic beings. Paul also uses an allegory in Galatians 4:21-31 to contrast Hagar (representing the non-Jews) with Sarah (representing the free woman, Jerusalem above), stating that those who desire to be subject to the law have fallen away from Christ.

#### D. The Tone and Content of Galatians

The letter's tone and content suggest that Paul may have lost the battle in the Galatian churches, leading him to abandon them. However, his reputation as an antinomian was already established by this time, as seen in Romans 3:8, where he denies charges of saying "let us do evil that good may come."

### II. The Roman Letter and Paul's Nuanced View
#### A. Introduction to the Roman Letter

Paul presents a nuanced view of the law in his letter to the Romans, acknowledging its goodness and holiness while also emphasizing that it cannot justify humans in God's sight.

#### B. The Law as a Witness to God's Righteousness

In Romans 3:31, Paul states that apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed, attested by both the Torah and the prophets. This suggests that the law bears witness to God's righteousness, rather than being a means of justification itself.

#### C. Faith as the Primary Means of Justification

Paul notes that boasting is excluded by faith, not works prescribed by the law (Romans 3:27-28), indicating that faith is the primary means of justification.

#### D. The Law and Sin in Romans 7:12

In Romans 7:12, Paul describes sin as an intelligent agent that uses the Commandment to deceive and kill humans, highlighting its power over human nature. However, he also emphasizes that the law is holy and just, despite being used by sin to deceive people.

### III. The Roman Church and Paul's Ministry
#### A. The Predominantly Gentile Roman Church

The Roman church was predominantly Gentile at the time, requiring a different approach than Paul's letters to Jewish communities.

#### B. Paul's Ministry and the Collection for Jerusalem

Paul sees himself as the Apostle to the Gentiles, mirroring Peter's role among Jews, and believes that the Gentile churches should support the poor followers of Jesus in Jerusalem. This collection was a crucial aspect of Paul's ministry, symbolizing the relationship between Jewish and Gentile believers.

### IV. A New Interpretation of Romans
#### A. The Relationship Between the Nations (Gentiles) and Israel

A new interpretation of Romans has emerged in recent years, shifting focus from individual salvation to the relationship between the Nations (Gentiles) and Israel. Paul's apocalyptic expectation is presented in chapters 9-11, where he quotes Hosea and Isaiah to emphasize that Gentiles would become people of God at the end of time.

#### B. The Messiah and Unity Among All Nations

Paul's addition to this myth is that one does not need to keep the law to achieve this unity, making his views on the law secondary to his main point: Gentiles are now part of Israel.
