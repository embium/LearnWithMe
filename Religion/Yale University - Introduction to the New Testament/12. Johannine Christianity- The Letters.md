### I. Historical-Critical Approach to Biblical Analysis
#### A. Introduction to the Method

The historical-critical approach is a method used to analyze biblical texts as windows into their social, political, and church contexts. This approach aims to reconstruct what was happening in the first century with the growth of Christianity. By applying this method, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of early Christian literature and its development.

#### B. Key Principles of the Historical-Critical Approach

- **Analyzing the text as a product of its time**: The historical-critical approach considers the biblical text within its historical context, taking into account the social, cultural, and political factors that influenced its composition.
- **Reconstructing the author's intent**: This method aims to understand the original purpose and message intended by the author, rather than imposing modern interpretations or biases.
- **Considering multiple perspectives**: The historical-critical approach acknowledges that different texts may present varying views on a particular topic, reflecting diverse christologies and relationships with Jewish law.

#### C. Application of the Historical-Critical Approach

The instructor applies this method to the Gospel of John, examining its historical and social context. By analyzing the text in this way, scholars can gain insights into early Christian literature, particularly the development of Johannine Christianity.

### II. The Gospel of John
#### A. Contextualizing the Gospel of John

The Gospel of John is presented as a clue to understanding early Christian literature, particularly the development of Johannine Christianity. By having the Gospel of John, First John, Second John, and Third John, scholars can see three or four stages in the development of this form of Christianity.

#### B. Key Features of the Gospel of John

- **Jesus' conversations leading to division**: The Gospel of John presents Jesus' conversations as a source of division, particularly in chapters 3 and 8.
- **Metaphors and riddles**: Jesus often speaks in metaphors that are not clearly understood by his interlocutors, such as Nicodemus in chapter 3.

#### C. Christology in the Gospel of John

The instructor notes that the Gospel of John's christology is closest to Orthodox Christianity, particularly in its emphasis on Jesus' full divinity and co-equality with the Father.

### III. Early Christian Literature

- **Gospel of Luke**: Emphasizes Jesus as the Martyr Prophet.
- **Gospel of Thomas**: Features Jesus as an already resurrected figure who reveals hidden knowledge.

### IV. The Epistles of 1, 2, and 3 John
#### A. Connections with the Gospel of John

The instructor highlights the seeing, hearing, and touching motifs present in both texts, as well as the emphasis on Jesus' life and the importance of faith in him.

#### B. Christological Debates in the Epistles

- **Division within the community**: The Epistles reveal a community divided by christological debates.
- **Importance of confessing sin and loving one another**: The Epistles emphasize the importance of confessing sin and loving one another within the community, but not extending this love to outsiders.

#### C. Stages of Development in Early Christianity

The texts suggest four stages of development in early Christianity, each marked by different kinds of divisions and resulting in distinct forms of Christianity emerging.
