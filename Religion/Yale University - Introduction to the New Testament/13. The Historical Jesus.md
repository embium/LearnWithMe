### I. Understanding the Historical Jesus
#### A. The Challenge of Separating History from Theology

The concept of the historical Jesus is often misunderstood as referring to the actual events and circumstances surrounding Jesus' life. However, scholars approach this topic with a critical eye, recognizing that the Gospels are theological texts rather than strictly historical accounts. This distinction is crucial because it acknowledges that historians cannot pronounce on matters of faith or theology.

The birth narratives in Matthew and Luke present two distinct stories that cannot be harmonized without resorting to fantastical explanations. Similarly, the trial of Jesus as described in the Gospels is likely a construct of later Christian tradition, with no reliable historical evidence to support its details. Scholars are therefore skeptical about the accuracy of these accounts, and instead focus on what can be inferred about Jesus' life and teachings through critical analysis of the available data.

#### B. The Tools of Modern Historiography

Scholars use the tools of modern historiography to construct a historical Jesus. This approach involves analyzing the available data, including the Gospels, other ancient texts, and archaeological findings. By applying these methods, historians can infer what is likely about Jesus' life and teachings.
