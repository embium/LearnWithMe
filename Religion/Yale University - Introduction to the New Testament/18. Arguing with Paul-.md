### I. Diversity in Early Christianity: Views on the Law
#### A. The Role of the Jewish Law in Matthew's Gospel

Matthew presents Jesus' followers as expected to continue keeping the Jewish law, with no indication that it would be abrogated. This view emphasizes the universal observance of the law, suggesting its continued relevance for all believers.

- **Key Term:** _Torah_ (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) and _Halakha_ (Jewish tradition and practice)
- In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus' teachings are often presented as a fulfillment or expansion of existing Jewish law.
- The emphasis on keeping the law in Matthew may reflect the early Christian community's desire to maintain connections with their Jewish heritage.

#### B. Luke and Acts: The Law as an Ethnic Custom

In contrast to Matthew, Luke and Acts seem to treat the law as an ethnic custom similar to those of other ancient cultures. This view suggests that the law is specific to the Jewish people and not necessarily relevant for Gentile converts.

- **Key Term:** _Ethnic custom_ (a practice or tradition unique to a particular group)
- The Gospel of Luke presents Jesus' teachings in a way that emphasizes their universal applicability, rather than their connection to Jewish law.
- Acts portrays the early Christian community as one that is open to Gentile converts and does not emphasize the continued observance of Jewish law.

#### C. Paul's Teachings on the Law

Paul's teachings on the law are more radical, discouraging Gentile converts from keeping it. This view emphasizes faith in Jesus Christ as the primary aspect of Christian practice, rather than adherence to Jewish law.

- **Key Term:** _Justification by faith alone_ (the idea that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, without reliance on works or observance of Jewish law)
- Paul's letters emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for Gentile converts, rather than their observance of Jewish law.
- This view has been influential in shaping Christian theology and practice.

#### D. Marcion and the Rejection of Jewish Law

Some early Christians, like Marcion, rejected the Jewish law and scriptures entirely, substituting their own edited version of Luke and Paul's letters. This view represents a more extreme rejection of Jewish heritage and tradition.

- **Key Term:** _Marcionism_ (a Christian movement that rejected the Jewish law and scriptures)
- Marcion's views represent a significant departure from mainstream Christianity and have been influential in shaping some Christian traditions.
- The rejection of Jewish law and scriptures by Marcion reflects a more radical form of early Christian diversity.

### II. Christology in Early Christianity
#### A. The Gospel of John: Jesus as Always Divine

The Gospel of John presents a christology where Jesus was always divine, rather than becoming divine at his birth, baptism, or resurrection. This view emphasizes the pre-existence and divinity of Jesus from the beginning.

- **Key Term:** _Pre-existent Christ_ (the idea that Jesus existed before creation and is co-eternal with God)
- The Gospel of John presents a high christology, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and role in creation.
- This view has been influential in shaping Christian theology and practice.

#### B. Other Views on the Divinity of Jesus

Some early Christians believed that Jesus became divine at his birth, baptism, or resurrection, rather than being always divine. These views represent a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' nature and role.

- **Key Term:** _Incarnation_ (the idea that God took on human form in Jesus Christ)
- The varying views on the divinity of Jesus reflect the diversity of early Christian thought.
- This diversity has been influential in shaping Christian theology and practice.

### III. James and Paul: Faith and Works
#### A. James' View on Faith and Works

James presents a Jewish wisdom literature perspective that emphasizes the importance of faith and works, in contrast to Paul's more radical views on justification by faith alone. This view suggests that faith must be accompanied by actions and deeds.

- **Key Term:** _Faith without works is dead_ (the idea that true faith must be demonstrated through action)
- James' emphasis on justice and caring for the marginalized reflects his social context, where most members are poor.
- This understanding of works is distinct from Paul's focus on Jewish law and circumcision.

#### B. The Relationship Between James and Paul

The relationship between James and Paul remains complex, with some scholars arguing that they do not fundamentally disagree, while others suggest that they may be operating with different definitions of faith and works, or that James is responding to a specific version of Christianity that he views as problematic.

- **Key Term:** _Different definitions of faith and works_ (the idea that James and Paul may have had distinct understandings of these concepts)
- The debate between James and Paul reflects the diversity of early Christian thought.
- This complexity has been influential in shaping Christian theology and practice.
