### I. The Acts of Thea: A Radical Form of Early Christianity
#### A. Overview and Context

The Acts of Thea is a non-canonical early Christian text that presents a radical form of Christianity, emphasizing complete sexual abstinence as a means to achieve spiritual purity. Composed in the second century, this document was considered good literature by many early Christians but was not part of the New Testament due to its later composition and lack of explicit Christian affiliation.

#### B. The Apocrypha: A Separate Body of Texts

The Apocrypha, which includes Jewish literature written during the Second Temple period, is often misunderstood as being part of the Christian canon. However, it is actually a separate body of texts that were rejected by Protestant reformers like Martin Luther and Calvin. This distinction is crucial in understanding the context and significance of The Acts of Thea.

#### C. Literary Conventions and Themes

The Acts of Thea draws on ancient Greek novels' conventions of depicting beautiful young people who are faithful to their lovers despite societal pressures. The text features a young woman named Thea who falls in love with Paul's preaching and becomes enamored with his gospel, eventually renouncing her engagement to follow him. This narrative presents a world where sex is the driving force behind human relationships but also teaches that complete sexual abstinence is necessary for spiritual purity and resurrection.

#### D. Radical Asceticism and Early Christianity

Radical asceticism was a key aspect of early Christianity, particularly in the Roman Catholic Church up until the Reformation. The emphasis on celibacy as superior to sexuality reflects this radical message. In contrast, the dominant form of household in most Christianity during this period was not the nuclear family but rather an extended household run by the male head of household.

#### E. Societal Norms and the Role of Women

The Acts of Thea challenges societal norms where women were considered inferior to men and their primary role was as childbearers. This text presents a radical message: breaking the cycle of sex, birth, death, and decay by avoiding sex and focusing on resurrection. This message is in tension with the Pastoral Epistles, which advocated for marriage and family.

#### F. The Author's Perspective and Message

The author of The Acts of Thea likely presents Paul's gospel in an anti-marriage, anti-household, and anti-childbirth context, appealing to young people, women, and the marginalized. This text highlights the tension between male heads of households who maintained power through sex and childbirth, and those who sought liberation from this patriarchal system.

#### G. Thea as a Protagonist: Embodiment of the Message

Thea, a protagonist, embodies this message by refusing her role as a baby factory, baptizing herself, and becoming an apostle to spread the gospel of avoiding sex and household structures. This text raises questions about its feminist credentials and whether it attacks or is attacked by the Pastoral Epistles.

#### H. Conclusion

The Acts of Thea presents a radical form of early Christianity that emphasizes complete sexual abstinence as a means to achieve spiritual purity. This text challenges societal norms, particularly those related to women's roles in society. Its message raises questions about its feminist credentials and its relationship with the Pastoral Epistles, which present a diametrically opposed message.
