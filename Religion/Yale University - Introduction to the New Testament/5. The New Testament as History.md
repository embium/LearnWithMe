### I. The New Testament as Historical Source
#### A. Overview of the New Testament Texts

The New Testament is a collection of texts that provide most of our information about Jesus of Nazareth and Paul, one of the earliest Christian leaders. While these texts are considered sacred by many Christians, they also offer valuable historical insights for scholars. However, it's essential to approach these texts with a critical eye, recognizing that their purpose is often theological rather than historical.

#### B. The Problem of Reliability in New Testament Sources

Most historians consider the second-century sources claiming to be letters by Paul as unreliable. This means that our primary source for understanding Paul comes from his own letters and other New Testament texts like Acts and Galatians. However, these texts were written with a theological agenda, which can lead to discrepancies and inconsistencies when examined historically.

#### C. The Accounts of Paul's Life in the New Testament

The New Testament contains two main sources that provide information about Paul's life: Acts and Galatians. These accounts often differ significantly from each other, highlighting the need for critical analysis and nuanced understanding.

### II. Discrepancies in the Accounts of Paul's Life
#### A. The Account of Paul's Conversion in Galatians

In his letter to the Galatians, Paul describes his conversion experience as a direct revelation from Jesus Christ. This account emphasizes that he received his gospel directly from God rather than from any human source. Paul also recounts a Jerusalem conference where leaders Peter, James, and John agreed that Gentiles did not need to be circumcised to follow the faith.

#### B. The Account of Paul's Conversion in Acts

In contrast, the writer of Acts portrays Paul as Saul, witnessing the stoning of Stephen and later being introduced to the church by Barnabas. He then goes on a missionary journey with Barnabas, visiting various cities and having a confrontation with a magician named Bar-Jesus. The two eventually split up due to a disagreement over whether to take John Mark on the next journey.

#### C. Discrepancies Between Acts and Galatians

The accounts of Paul's early life in Jerusalem and Judea are inconsistent across different biblical texts, with some sources suggesting he was present in Jerusalem multiple times while others imply a more limited presence. Historians have debated which account is more accurate, with some arguing that the writer of Acts had an agenda to portray the church as harmonious and unified.

### III. Approaching the New Testament as Historical Source
#### A. The Importance of Critical Analysis

As historians, it's essential to approach these texts with scrutiny and suspicion, recognizing that every written account has a point of view and agenda. By carefully sifting through these documents, one can attempt to extract reliable historical data.

#### B. Recognizing the Context in Which the Texts Were Written

It's crucial to understand the context in which the New Testament texts were written. These texts were composed with a theological purpose, often emphasizing unity and harmony within the early Christian community. This context should inform our interpretation of these texts as historical sources.

#### C. The Value of Paul's Letters as Historical Evidence

Many scholars consider Paul's letters, particularly Galatians, to be firsthand accounts that provide more reliable historical evidence due to his personal involvement and strong emphasis on certain events. However, even within Acts, there is some debate about whether the writer was an eyewitness or relied on other sources.

### IV. Conclusion
#### A. The Challenge of Extracting Historical Data from Theological Texts

The New Testament offers valuable insights into the life and ministry of Paul, but it's essential to approach these texts with a critical eye. By recognizing the theological agenda behind these texts and carefully analyzing their content, historians can attempt to extract reliable historical data.

#### B. The Importance of Nuanced Understanding

Ultimately, the task requires nuanced understanding of the context in which these texts were written. By acknowledging the complexities and discrepancies within these accounts, we can gain a more accurate picture of Paul's life and ministry.
