### I. The Hebrew Bible's Chronological End and the Hellenistic Period
#### A. Introduction to the Hebrew Bible's Chronology

The Old Testament Hebrew Bible's chronological end takes place in the 6th century BCE, marking the conclusion of the story as it is traditionally understood. However, this date does not reflect the latest literature within the Hebrew Bible. The Jews' experience under Babylonian captivity, their subsequent return to Judea, and the rebuilding of the Temple and Jerusalem's walls are documented in Ezra and Nehemiah.

#### B. The Discrepancy Between Story and Literature

The Book of Daniel, which claims to be written during Babylonian captivity, is actually dated around 164 BCE, making it the latest document in the Hebrew Bible. This discrepancy highlights a difference between the actual timing of documents and the chronological end of the story.

#### C. The Hellenistic Period and Its Impact on Judea

The Hellenistic period, marked by Alexander the Great's universal empire, Greek culture, and syncretism, was significant for the Jews living under Antiochus IV Epiphanes' rule in Judea. As the Jews were caught between the Syrian and Egyptian empires, they faced constant battles and attempts to assimilate into Hellenistic culture.

#### D. Jewish Leaders and the Maccabean Revolt

Some Jewish leaders, like Jason, promoted Greek education and culture, while others, such as Onias IV, withdrew from Jerusalem and built a new Temple. The Hasidim, or "holy ones," were a group of Jews who rejected Greek culture and promoted Hebrew texts and law. Matathias, a priest, led a revolt against Antiochus' rule, which eventually resulted in the Maccabean Revolt and the cleansing of the Temple in 164 BCE.

### II. The Book of Daniel
#### A. Introduction to the Book of Daniel

The Book of Daniel contains prophecies and visions that tell the story of human history, including the rise and fall of kingdoms, with some events already having occurred by Daniel's time. The book is a prime example of apocalyptic literature that provides a vision of future events, particularly in relation to the Maccabean period.

#### B. Authorship and Historical Accuracy

The author, writing under the name of Daniel, sets himself up as a wise man from the distant past, yet his knowledge of historical events is remarkably accurate, including the rise and fall of various kingdoms and empires. However, when it comes to the specific details of Antiochus IV's reign, the author's information appears to be limited to 167 BCE, suggesting that the book was written around this time.

#### C. The Book of Daniel and Apocalyptic Worldview

The text describes a series of battles and alliances between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom, with Judea caught in the middle. It also mentions the eventual defeat of Antiochus IV by forces sent by him, which is likely a reference to the Roman Empire's intervention. The author notes that God will ultimately break into history and bring about the final victory, rather than relying on human efforts to achieve it.

#### D. Influence on Early Christianity

This apocalyptic worldview would later become influential in early Christianity, with Jesus and his followers adopting similar perspectives. In contrast, Judaism underwent significant changes after 70 CE, particularly with the destruction of the Temple and the rise of rabbinic Judaism.

### III. The Jewish Revolt and Rabbinic Judaism
#### A. Introduction to the Jewish Revolt

The Jewish Revolt of 66-74 CE was a major event that led to the eventual Roman conquest of Jerusalem, marking a significant turning point in Jewish history.

#### B. The Rise of Rabbinic Judaism

The subsequent development of Rabin Judaism as a central organizing feature of Jewish life is a direct result of this revolt and the destruction of the Temple. This shift had far-reaching implications for Jewish identity and practice, setting the stage for the diverse forms of Judaism that exist today.

#### C. Conclusion

In conclusion, the Hebrew Bible's chronological end and the Hellenistic period are crucial contexts for understanding the Book of Daniel and its apocalyptic worldview. The Maccabean Revolt and the rise of rabbinic Judaism also played significant roles in shaping Jewish history and identity.
