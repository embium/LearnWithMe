### I. The Gospel of Luke and Acts: A Shared Authorship
#### A. Introduction to the Author and Their Purpose

The Gospel of Luke and Acts are two volumes written by the same author, with almost no scholarly doubt about their shared origin. This suggests that they were not an eyewitness to the events themselves but rather compiled sources from others. The author presents themselves as writing an "orderly account" of events that have been fulfilled among them, based on eyewitnesses and servants of the word.

#### B. Structure and Literary Forms

The Gospel of Luke is structured around Jesus' life, with a focus on his Galilean ministry, while Acts follows the early Christian community's expansion beyond Jerusalem. The author's use of literary forms and genres, such as bios (a genre that tells about great men) and history, indicates their self-consciousness in setting themselves forward as a literary work.

#### C. The Author's Use of Transitions and Themes

The author's use of transitions between chapters and sections suggests a deliberate attempt to create a cohesive narrative across both volumes. This is evident in the way they weave together themes and motifs throughout the two books. For example, the theme of Jesus' first sermon in Luke 4:14-30 sets the tone for his Galilean ministry, emphasizing his connection to Jewish scripture and tradition.

#### D. The Theme of Reversal of Fortunes

The theme of reversal of fortunes is a central idea throughout both volumes. In Luke 4:14-30, Jesus delivers a sermon in Nazareth that emphasizes this theme, where the high will be sent down low and the low will be raised up high. This theme is already present in the Gospel of Luke and is echoed in Jesus' quote from Scripture about proclaiming the year of the Lord's favor.

#### E. The Mission to the Gentiles

Jesus sets himself up as a prophet like Elijah, who helped a non-Jewish widow, not a Jewish one, and healed a Gentile leper, not a Jewish one. This highlights Jesus' mission to the Gentiles, which is a theme that will be developed further in Acts. The rejection of Jesus by his own people foreshadows the rejection of the gospel by Jews and its subsequent spread to the Gentiles.

#### F. The Structure of Acts

The book of Acts is structured around the idea of the gospel spreading in concentric circles from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and finally to the ends of the earth, with Rome representing the ultimate destination. Luke's focus on Jerusalem as the center of the gospel message is evident throughout his writings, but he also highlights the fact that the gospel goes beyond Jerusalem.

#### G. The Insertion of Events in Acts

In Acts 11:19-20, Luke records the first time the message was taken to the Gentiles, but this is actually a later event that has been inserted into the narrative to emphasize the theme of the gospel going beyond Jerusalem. This insertion highlights the author's deliberate attempt to create a cohesive narrative across both volumes.
