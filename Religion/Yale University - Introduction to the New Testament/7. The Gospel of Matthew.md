### I. The Gospel of Matthew: A Comprehensive Overview
#### A. Historical Significance and Popularity

The Gospel of Matthew has been the most popular and familiar Gospel throughout history, both among Christians and non-Christians. Its widespread use in Christian tradition and inclusion as the first book in the Bible have contributed to its enduring popularity.

#### B. Jewish Roots and Cultural Context
Matthew's narrative is deeply rooted in Jewish culture and scripture, with Jesus being portrayed as a new Moses who fulfills the law. This portrayal has significant implications for understanding Matthew's message and its relationship to Judaism.

*   **Jesus as a New Moses**: In Matthew, Jesus is depicted as a figure who embodies the spirit of the law, rather than abolishing it. This emphasis on fulfilling the law rather than superseding it challenges the common Christian view that Jesus did away with Jewish legalism.
*   **The Law in Matthew's Gospel**: The Gospel presents Jesus as a preventative figure who spiritualizes the law, focusing on what comes out of one's mouth rather than what goes into it. This approach highlights the importance of faith and obedience to God's law.

#### C. The Great Commission and Universalizing Message
Matthew's Great Commission, which concludes the Gospel, emphasizes Jesus' command to his disciples to make disciples of all nations. This universalizing message has been interpreted as a call to spread Christianity throughout the world.

*   **The Significance of the Great Commission**: The Great Commission serves as a conclusion to Matthew's Gospel and underscores its emphasis on spreading the gospel to all nations.
*   **Implications for Christian Tradition**: The Great Commission has had significant implications for Christian tradition, shaping the way Christians understand their role in spreading the message of Jesus Christ.

#### D. Matthew's Structure and Interpretation
Matthew's structure, with five speeches by Jesus, has been interpreted by some as an imitation of the five books of the Torah. However, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and scholars continue to debate the significance of Matthew's structure.

*   **The Five Speeches in Matthew**: The five speeches attributed to Jesus in Matthew have been seen as a deliberate attempt to mirror the structure of the Torah.
*   **Interpretations and Debates**: Scholars have offered various interpretations of Matthew's structure, with some seeing it as an imitation of the Torah and others viewing it as a unique contribution to Christian tradition.

#### E. Paradoxical Behavior in Matthew
Matthew portrays Jesus as a teacher who emphasizes the importance of faith and obedience to God's law. However, Jesus' own behavior in the face of danger is often depicted as retreating or withdrawing, which may seem contradictory to his teachings.

*   **Jesus' Withdrawal from Danger**: The Gospel presents Jesus as a figure who retreats from persecution and then continues to preach and expand the gospel.
*   **The Disciples' Role**: The disciples are also instructed to retreat in the face of danger, but ultimately they will go on to preach to the entire world.

#### F. Redaction Criticism and Matthew's Sources
Through redaction criticism, scholars have analyzed Matthew's use of sources such as Mark and Q, and have concluded that Matthew is presenting a Torah-observant form of Christianity where Gentiles are expected to keep Jewish law.

*   **Matthew's Use of Sources**: The Gospel of Matthew has been subject to redaction criticism, which has revealed its use of sources such as Mark and Q.
*   **Implications for Christian Tradition**: The findings of redaction criticism have significant implications for understanding the development of Christianity and its relationship to Judaism.
