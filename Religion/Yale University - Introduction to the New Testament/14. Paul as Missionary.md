### I. The Historical Figure of Paul: Separating Fact from Legend

#### A. Overview of the Debate Surrounding Paul's Life and Ministry

The historical figure of Paul is shrouded in debate among scholars, with questions surrounding what can be known historically about him versus the literary accounts. Unlike Jesus, for whom we have limited historical information, we have at least seven letters from Paul that most scholars believe are authentic to him. However, this does not mean that everything attributed to Paul is historical fact. In fact, there is still significant debate about what is historical and what is later legend or invention.

#### B. The Book of Acts: A Narrative Account of Paul's Life and Ministry

The book of Acts presents a narrative account of Paul's life and ministry, but it often contradicts the accounts in his own letters, such as Galatians 1 and 2. Scholars have questioned the historicity of certain events described in Acts, suggesting that they may be later additions or embellishments. Despite this, there are some key details about Paul that can be gleaned from his letters.

#### C. Key Details About Paul's Life and Ministry

- **Paul's Jewish Background**: In Philippians 3:5-6, Paul describes himself as a Pharisee and a member of the tribe of Benjamin, indicating that he was deeply rooted in Jewish tradition.
- **Persecutor to Follower**: Paul claims to have been a persecutor of the church before becoming a follower of Jesus, motivated by zeal for the law. This challenges the common portrayal of Paul as someone who struggled with the law and ultimately discovered grace through faith.
- **Education and Language**: Paul's letters suggest that he may have spoken Greek as his primary language rather than Hebrew or Aramaic.

#### D. Discrepancies Between Acts and Paul's Letters

- **Account of Paul's Visit to Thessalonica**: The account in Acts 17 is at odds with the description in First Thessalonians, where Paul describes himself and Silas as missionaries who went from town to town preaching about Jesus Christ.
- **Persecution Faced by the Thessalonian Church**: Unlike the narrative in Acts, there is no mention of Jews persecuting the Thessalonians; instead, it was their fellow Greeks who were causing trouble.

#### E. Paul's Letters: A Different Picture

- **Paul as a Skilled Craftsman**: The letter to the Thessalonians highlights Paul's manual labor and self-sufficiency, noting that he and his companions did not live off handouts from the community while preaching the gospel.
- **The Composition of the Thessalonian Church**: The letter implies that the Thessalonian church was composed entirely of Gentiles, who had turned away from idol worship and polytheism to follow Jesus.

#### F. Paul's Explanation of the Parousia

A significant aspect of 1 Thessalonians is Paul's explanation of what happens to those who have died before Jesus returns; he reassures the Thessalonians that they will not miss out on the parousia (the coming of Jesus), as the dead in Christ will rise first, followed by the living believers being caught up together with them. This revelation fills a significant gap in their knowledge and understanding of Christian theology.

#### G. Conclusion

Despite the discrepancies between Acts and Paul's letters, scholars continue to study and debate the historical figure of Paul, seeking to separate fact from legend and understand his significance within the broader context of early Christianity.
