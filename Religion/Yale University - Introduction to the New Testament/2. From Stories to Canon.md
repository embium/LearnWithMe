### I. Scripture and Canon: Understanding the Difference
#### A. Definition and Significance

Scripture and canon are two distinct concepts in religious studies, often used interchangeably but with significant differences. **Scripture** refers to writings considered holy and authoritative by a particular community, while **canon** implies a set list of texts adhered to by a religious body.

In Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, there exist canons consisting of core texts: the Quran for Islam, the Hebrew Bible for Judaism, and the Hebrew Bible plus the New Testament for Christians. The process of establishing these canons involved the collection and circulation of sacred writings over time.

#### B. Establishing the Christian New Testament Canon

The Christian New Testament canon was established through a gradual process spanning several centuries. This process began with the collection and circulation of Paul's letters, which were considered scripture by early Christians. These letters were written around 50-60 AD, with the oldest being First Thessalonians.

As churches copied and circulated these letters, they also began to write their own texts, such as the Gospel of Mark, which was likely written around 70 AD. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke followed, using Mark as a source. However, not all early Christian texts were included in the final canon.

#### C. Consideration of Other Texts

The process of establishing the New Testament canon involved consideration of various texts, including:

*   The Gospel of Thomas
*   The Gospel of Judas
*   Marcion's canon, which consisted of the Gospel of Luke and ten letters of Paul that he believed were authentic

These texts were not ultimately included in the final canon, but their existence highlights the complexity and nuance involved in establishing a religious canon.

#### D. Factors Influencing the Canon

The decision to include certain texts in the New Testament canon was influenced by various factors, including:

*   **Popularity**: The four Gospels we have today (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) were likely chosen due to their widespread acceptance and perceived authority.
*   **Geographical spread**: Texts that were widely accepted across different geographical areas were more likely to be included in the canon.
*   **Theological acceptability**: Documents that matched one's own theology were more likely to be included in the canon.

#### E. The Protestant Bible and the Catholic Old Testament

The Protestant Bible is based on the Hebrew Bible, which was translated into Greek during the rabbinic period. Early Christians accepted all these books as Scripture, but at the Reformation, Martin Luther and others decided to go back to the original Hebrew texts and exclude the Greek Jewish documents, now known as the Apocrypha.

The Catholic Old Testament includes these additional books, while the Protestant Bible does not. The Eastern Orthodox Church also has a different canon, with some books included that are not found in the Western Christian Bible.

#### F. Criteria for Inclusion

The criteria for inclusion in the canon were not inspiration or apostolic authorship, as is often assumed today. Instead, it seems that the most ancient texts with close proximity to Jesus were preferred, followed by general acceptance across different geographical areas, and finally theological acceptability.

#### G. Attribution of Authors

The names associated with many New Testament books were not original authors but rather later attributions made to give them authority. The process of establishing the canon was complex and influenced by various factors over several centuries.
