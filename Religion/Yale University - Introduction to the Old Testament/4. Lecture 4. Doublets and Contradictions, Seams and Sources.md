### I. The Genesis Creation Story: A Narrative Paralleling Ancient Epic Tales
#### A. Connection to the Epic of Gilgamesh

The second creation story in Genesis 2-3 presents a narrative that parallels the Epic of Gilgamesh, highlighting the complexities of human nature and the consequences of disobedience. This parallelism is striking, as both stories feature a character's transformation from innocence to wisdom coming at a cost.

*   In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Enkidu's seven-day encounter with a woman makes him wise but also loses his harmony with nature.
*   Similarly, in Genesis 2-3, Adam and Eve's defiance of God's command leads to their expulsion from the Garden, suggesting that knowledge or wisdom may come at a high price.

The biblical account explores the theme of mortality, with God banishing Adam and Eve from the Garden due to their newfound moral freedom, which would have allowed them access to immortality if they had conformed to God's will. The motif of guards blocking access to the tree of life implies that no humans have access to immortality, making the pursuit of it futile.

#### B. The Significance of Mortality and Moral Freedom

The story assumes the existence of a universal moral law, which is violated by Cain's murder of Abel, highlighting the sanctity of human life and the tension between settled areas and unsettled desert life. This narrative draws on older traditions and motifs, adapting them to its own purposes.

*   The flood story that follows shares similarities with the Epic of Gilgamesh and other ancient accounts.
*   The biblical account of the flood story in Genesis 6-9 presents a complex narrative, with multiple layers and contradictions that suggest a composite structure.

#### C. The Complexity of the Flood Story

The flood story has two distinct versions:

1.  One where God destroys humanity due to their wickedness (Genesis 6:5)
2.  Another where the reason for the destruction is not explicitly stated (Genesis 7:1)

This ambiguity is further complicated by the use of different Hebrew words for God, with Yahweh representing a more personal and transcendent deity, while Elohim is used in Genesis 1 to describe a remote and abstract creator.

The flood story also contains contradictions regarding the duration of the flood:

*   Some passages state it lasted 40 days (Genesis 7:17)
*   Others claim it was 150 days (Genesis 7:24)

Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the instructions given by God for building the ark, with two sets of instructions provided.

#### D. Implications for Authorship and Composition

The presence of contradictions and repetitions throughout the Bible raises questions about its authorship and composition, leading some scholars to conclude that it was written by multiple authors over time. This challenges traditional notions of Mosaic authorship and the perfection of the Bible as a unified voice on matters of doctrine or religious theology.

*   The complexity of the flood story and other narratives in Genesis suggests a composite structure.
*   The use of different Hebrew words for God and the contradictions regarding the duration of the flood imply revisions and compilations from multiple sources.
