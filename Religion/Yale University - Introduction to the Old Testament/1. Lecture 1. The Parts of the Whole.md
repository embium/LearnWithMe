### I. Introduction to Ancient Human Civilization
#### A. Overview of Archaeological Discoveries

The study of ancient human civilization has undergone significant changes with archaeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. These findings have revealed remarkable peoples and cultures, including massive empires that had disappeared from human memory. The discovery of new civilizations has expanded our understanding of human history and culture.

#### B. Key Findings and Implications

- **The concept of one divine power outside of nature**: Archaeological discoveries have highlighted the significance of this idea among ancient civilizations. The Ancient Near Eastern people who left a lasting legacy were not those who built great centers of civilization, but rather those who had this revolutionary idea.
- **Survival as an ethnic religious entity**: This unique idea enabled the Israelites to survive as an ethnic religious entity despite conquests and exiles.

### II. The Bible: A Collection of Writings
#### A. Overview of the Bible

The Bible is a collection of writings that reflect diverse perspectives on life, morality, and faith. It contains the Hebrew Bible, which is common to all Bibles. The Bible is not a book with a uniform style or message but rather an anthology of writings by people in different situations responding to various issues and stimuli.

#### B. Characteristics of Biblical Writings

- **Psychologically realistic stories**: The narratives within the Bible are psychologically realistic stories about real people and their experiences, not pious parables about saints.
- **Exploration of moral issues**: These stories explore moral issues and situations, leaving conclusions for readers to draw.
- **Treatment of existential and moral issues**: The Bible treats these issues indirectly using the language of story, song, and paradox.

#### C. Formation and Editing of the Bible

The Bible's formulation and editing involved many human contributors over centuries, with individual styles and concerns betraying their political and religious motivations. Its document basis for religious faith among millions of people makes its study inevitable in this course.

### III. The Hebrew Bible: A Primary Concern
#### A. Overview of the Hebrew Bible

The Hebrew Bible, comprising 24 books grouped into Torah, Prophets, and Writings, is our primary concern. It is a remarkable volume that preserves the rich history and literature of ancient Israel.

#### B. Impact on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam

- **Judaism**: The Hebrew Bible has had a profound impact on Jewish faith and culture.
- **Christianity**: It also played a significant role in the development of Christian theology and practice.
- **Islam**: Similarly, it influenced Islamic thought and tradition.

#### C. Complexities of Biblical Canonization

The course will delve into the complexities of biblical canonization, including:

- **Apocrypha**: A collection of writings not included in the Hebrew Bible but found in some Christian Bibles.
- **Pseudepigrapha**: Writings attributed to biblical figures or other ancient authors, often with theological purposes.

### IV. Conclusion and Course Objectives
#### A. Academic Approaches

The course will take an academic approach to ensure a common ground and goals for discussions, acknowledging the role of divine inspiration as an article of faith while focusing on the demonstrably human component of the Bible's formulation and transmission.

#### B. Course Goals
