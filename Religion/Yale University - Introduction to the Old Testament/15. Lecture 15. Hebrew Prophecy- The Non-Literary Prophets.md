### I. The Deuteronomistic Historian's Interpretation of Israel's History
#### A. Sin and Punishment in the Book of 2 Kings

The Deuteronomistic historian interprets Israel's history through the lens of sin and punishment, attributing the nation's defeat and exile to the sin of idolatry, particularly the idolatry of the royal house. This interpretation is evident in the book of 2 Kings, where kings who permit sacrifice only at the Jerusalem Temple are praised, while those who do not are condemned.

The historian acknowledges that this interpretation does not align with the historical record, which shows both good and bad kings reigning for varying lengths of time. To account for these anomalies, the Deuteronomist introduces the theme of delayed punishment, where sin is punished after a period of time has passed. This is seen in the case of Jeroboam I, who installed cultic centers at Dan and Beth-El, leading to Israel's defeat at the hands of the Assyrians in 722.

The historian views Josiah as a good king for purging the country of idolatrous rites and centralizing worship in Jerusalem. In contrast, wicked kings like Manasseh are condemned for their idolatrous practices. The Deuteronomist sees God punishing Israel for its sin by raising up other nations to defeat them, with the Babylonians being the tool used to punish Judah.

#### B. The Historiosophy of 2 Kings 17

The historian's interpretation finds classic expression in 2 Kings 17, where the Israelites are blamed for their idolatrous practices and punished accordingly. This passage highlights the Deuteronomist's view that God punishes Israel for its sin by raising up other nations to defeat them.

### II. Apostolic Prophecy in Ancient Israel
#### A. Definition and Characteristics

Apostolic prophecy is a phenomenon unique to ancient Israel, where prophets were called by God to proclaim a message, announcing something on behalf of Yahweh. These prophets were not primarily fortunetellers but rather messengers who addressed specific historical situations and revealed God's immediate intentions as a response to the present circumstances.

#### B. Connection between Prophecy and Kingship

The connection between prophecy and kingship is close in ancient Israel, with prophets often anointing kings and announcing their fall from power. Prophetic opposition to kings is also a significant theme, with every king having his prophetic "thorn in the side." The stories of Samuel against Saul, Nathan against King David, Elijah against Ahab, Micaiah against Ahab, Elisha against the House of Ahab, and Jeremiah against the king set the stage for understanding the writings of the named prophets that will come later.

#### C. Roles of Prophets in the Stories of Samuel and Kings

The role of prophets in the stories of Samuel and Kings is multifaceted. Some prophets, like the court prophets, were yes-men who endorsed royal policy, while others, like Micaiah, son of Imlah, proclaimed the truth from Yahweh even if it displeased the king. The story of Micaiah's prophesying in 1 Kings 22 is a pointed critique of the prophetic yes-men who served as court prophets for King Ahab.

### III. Prophets and Kingship in Ancient Israel
#### A. True and False Prophets

The biblical narrative presents a complex portrayal of prophets, highlighting their roles as God's zealots, kingmakers and breakers, miracle workers, and consciences to the monarchs. The story of Micaiah serves as a prime example of a true prophet who delivers God's word despite opposition from the king and majority view. In contrast, false prophets are depicted as being misled by God or employed by kings to promote their interests.

#### B. Elijah and Elisha: Zealous Yahwists

Elijah and Elisha embody the role of zealous Yahwists, battling Baal worship and demonstrating exclusive devotion to Yahweh. Their stories, which originated as folk tales, were later incorporated into the Deuteronomistic history, highlighting the condemnation of idolatrous Israel and her kings.

#### C. The Conflict between Yahweh and Baal Cults

The conflict between Yahweh and Baal cults reaches a climax in 1 Kings 18, where Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal to a contest, showcasing Yahweh's power over nature and demonstrating that true prophets stand up against established interests.

### IV. The Classical Prophets
#### A. Definition and Characteristics

The classical prophets, including Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, Zechariah, Joel, and Malachi, responded to urgent crises in the life of the nation over a 320-year period.

#### B. Critical Periods

These prophets are grouped around four critical periods: the Assyrian crisis, the Babylonian crisis, the Exile, and the post-exilic or restoration community. Each period presents unique challenges and opportunities for the prophets to address specific historical situations and reveal God's immediate intentions as a response to the present circumstances.

#### C. The Significance of the Classical Prophets

The classical prophets played a crucial role in shaping Israel's history, providing guidance and critique to kings and monarchs, and announcing God's word to the nation. Their writings continue to be relevant today, offering insights into the nature of God, humanity, and the world we live in.
