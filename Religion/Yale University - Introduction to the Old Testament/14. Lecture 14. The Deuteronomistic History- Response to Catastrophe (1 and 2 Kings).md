### I. The Establishment of Kingship in Israel
#### A. Unique Royal Ideology

The establishment of kingship in Israel was distinct from other ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where kings were often considered divine or semi-divine. In contrast, Israelite royal ideology emphasized the king's role as a human appointed by God to end wickedness and bring prosperity to the nation. This ideology was heavily influenced by Canaanite royal traditions, which also featured kings as sons of the deity, but not necessarily implying divinity.

The concept of kingship in Israel was revolutionary, replacing an earlier understanding that the entire nation was God's son. With David's ascension to the throne, Jerusalem became a symbol of God's presence and the monarchy, representing the chosen dynasty and city. However, the biblical assessment of David is initially positive but later reveals his weaknesses, indecisiveness, and flaws, which are laid bare in the Court History or succession narrative of David.

This portrayal critiques the claim of kings to rule by divine right and emphasizes that even monarchs are subject to human errors and flaws. The establishment of monarchy in Israel led to fundamental changes in society, including a strong central administration headed by a king with a special covenant with God. This new royal ideology combined loyalty to God and loyalty to the throne, conflating treason against God's anointed as also being apostasy against God Himself.

#### B. Influence from Canaanite Royal Traditions

The Israelite royal ideology was influenced by Canaanite royal traditions, which featured kings as sons of the deity. However, unlike other ancient Near Eastern monarchies, the Israelite concept did not imply divinity for their kings. Instead, it emphasized the king's role as a human appointed by God to lead the nation.

The temple on Mount Zion came to be understood as sacred space, similar to other traditions' cosmic mountains. It was described as a paradise, the place of creation, and an epitome of the world. The temple represented an ideal and sacred realm, and its dedication is recorded in 1 Kings 8, where Solomon explains that it's a house of prayer where people can access God and atone for their sins.

#### C. Critique of Royal Ideology

The biblical text presents a nuanced view of royal ideology, highlighting both the benefits and drawbacks of monarchical rule. The establishment of monarchy in Israel led to significant changes in society, including a strong central administration headed by a king with a special covenant with God.

However, this new royal ideology also created tension between covenant theology and royal ideology. The Deuteronomistic historian attempted to reconcile these two strands of tradition, depicting leaders of Israel as having the choice to accept or reject God's way, and their wrong choices leading to the fall of the kingdom.

### II. The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah
#### A. The Northern Kingdom of Israel

The northern kingdom of Israel was established under Jeroboam, who attempted to break the connection with Jerusalem by establishing his own government at Shechem and royal shrines in Dan and Bethel. This was seen as a terrible sin by the Deuteronomistic historian, echoing the story of the golden calf in Exodus 32.

The northern kingdom experienced material prosperity under Omri and Ahab, but they were criticized for their idolatrous practices and syncretism. The Assyrian empire eventually conquered Israel in 722, reducing it to a province. Many governing class members, including wealthy merchants, were carried off into exile in northern Mesopotamia, becoming the lost tribes of Israel.

#### B. The Southern Kingdom of Judah

The southern kingdom of Judah remained loyal to the house of David but became subject allies or vassals of Assyria after Israel's defeat. Hezekiah prepared for rebellion and made alliances with neighbors, prompting the Assyrians to lay siege to Jerusalem. However, Judah was able to withstand the siege, and eventually, the Assyrian empire fell to the rising Babylonians.

#### C. The Deuteronomistic Historian's Response

The Deuteronomistic historian attempted to respond to the collapse of the Israelite nation by adopting a particular interpretation of history, which became known as the historiosophy of the Deuteronomistic school. This response reconciled the disasters of 722 and 586 with the conviction that God controlled history and had an eternal covenant with the patriarchs and David.

The Deuteronomistic historian depicted leaders of Israel as having the choice to accept or reject God's way, and their wrong choices leading to the fall of the kingdom. Being a son means receiving correction, discipline, and punishment from God, which is a fundamental aspect of their relationship. This concept is deeply rooted in the history of a particular people group, where certain segments were led to believe that God's strength and faithfulness were proven through a series of events.

### III. Conclusion
The establishment of kingship in Israel was a unique phenomenon in the ancient Near East, emphasizing the king's role as a human appointed by God to lead the nation. The biblical text presents a nuanced view of royal ideology, highlighting both the benefits and drawbacks of monarchical rule.

The kingdoms of Israel and Judah experienced significant changes and challenges throughout their histories, including the collapse of the northern kingdom and the eventual fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians. The Deuteronomistic historian's response to these events attempted to reconcile the disasters with the conviction that God controlled history and had an eternal covenant with the patriarchs and David.

This understanding has profound implications for our understanding of God's relationship with humanity, particularly in the context of a particular people group. The concept of being a son means receiving correction, discipline, and punishment from God, which is a fundamental aspect of their relationship.
