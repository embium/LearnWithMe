### I. The Documentary Hypothesis: Understanding the Composition of the Bible
#### A. Overview of the Documentary Hypothesis

The documentary hypothesis proposes that the biblical text was composed from four identifiable source documents: J, E, D, and P. These sources were woven together to form the narrative core of the Bible, reflecting different interests and concerns. The documentary hypothesis is a crucial tool for understanding the history of Israelite religion and the composition of the Bible.

#### B. The Sources: J, E, D, and P

- **J Source**: Begins with Genesis 2:4, uses a personal name for God (Yahweh), and describes God in anthropomorphic terms. It is dated to around the tenth century BCE, likely composed in Judah during the reign of King Solomon.
- **E Source**: Uses Elohim as the name for God and has a more remote view of God, with indirect communications through messengers or dreams. The E source is thought to have been composed in the northern kingdom around the ninth century BCE.
- **D Source**: Emphasizes the importance of one central sanctuary and reflects settled agrarian life. It is dated to the eighth century BCE, likely composed in the north before being brought to Jerusalem after the fall of the Northern Kingdom.
- **P Source**: Focuses on religious institutions, rituals, and holiness, with a concern for priestly material that is often seen as degenerate or late. However, this dating owes more to Wellhausen's biases than objective analysis.

#### C. The Significance of the Documentary Hypothesis

Despite its limitations, the documentary hypothesis remains an important tool for understanding the history of Israelite religion and the composition of the Bible. It has undergone significant developments over the centuries, with various methodologies emerging to study the text. While source criticism has been supplemented by new approaches, many alternative methods assume some form of sources, even if not all details are known.

### II. The Story of the Tower of Babel: A Bridge Between Universal and Ethnic Focus
#### A. Overview

The story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11 serves as a bridge between the universal scope of the first section of Genesis and the focus on one ethnic, linguistic group and land that begins in Chapter 12.

#### B. Interpretations of the Tower of Babel

- The tower's construction is seen as displeasing to God, with various interpretations suggesting it represents a rejection of civilization or a defiance of God's design for humanity.
- This event marks a significant shift in the biblical narrative from a universal setting to a focus on one ethnic group and land.

### III. Shifts in Focus: From Universal to Patriarchal
#### A. Overview

The biblical narrative has shifted its focus dramatically from the universal setting of the first 11 chapters of Genesis to the patriarchs and matriarchs in the rest of the book. This shift is attributed to God's withdrawal of his focus due to humanity's poor use of their moral freedom, leading him to choose one small group, the Israelites, to reveal himself to.

### IV. Recent Biblical Scholarship: New Critical Methodologies
#### A. Overview

In recent biblical scholarship, a new wave of critical methodologies has emerged, focusing on the pre-history of sources and the transmission of traditional material.

#### B. Form Criticism and Tradition Criticism

- **Form Criticism**: Developed by Hermann Gunkel, identifies older, pre-literary forms that have been taken up and adapted by the literary sources.
- **Tradition Criticism**: Examines the changes that occur in the transmission of traditional material.

### V. Analyzing Genesis 12 and Beyond: Historical or Fictional?
#### A. Overview

As we move forward in studying Genesis 12 and beyond, it is essential to consider whether this writing is historical or fictional, what criteria make some writing historical, and where these genres come from.

#### B. Criteria for Historical Writing

- **Correlation of Biblical and Archaeological Data**: William F. Albright argued that archaeology supported the basic historicity of biblical tradition.
- **Chronology and Repetitions of Events**: There are problems with viewing the Bible as history, including issues with chronology and suspicious repetitions of events.

#### C. Conclusion

Understanding the composition of the Bible through the documentary hypothesis is crucial for grasping the historical context and development of Israelite religion. As we continue to study Genesis 12 and beyond, it is essential to consider the genres of writing, whether historical or fictional, and the criteria that make some writing historical.
