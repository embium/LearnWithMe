### I. Alternative Perspectives on Divinity: The Books of Esther and Jonah
#### A. Introduction to the Books of Esther and Jonah

The Book of Esther and the Book of Jonah present two distinct perspectives on divinity, offering insights into the Israelite concept of God's relationship with humanity. While both books deal with themes of salvation and redemption, they differ significantly in their approach and message.

- **Key Terms:** _Apocalyptic literature_ refers to a genre of writing that emphasizes divine intervention and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.
- **Context:** The stories of Esther and Jonah are set against the backdrop of ancient Near Eastern cultures, where the concept of divinity was often associated with power and authority.

#### B. The Book of Esther: A Heroic Jewish Figure

The Book of Esther presents an alternative to apocalyptic literature by depicting a heroic Jewish figure who saves his people through their own efforts, rather than relying on divine intervention. Set in fifth-century Persia, the story revolves around Mordechai and his adopted niece Esther, who becomes queen after her great beauty commends her to the king.

- **Key Events:**
  - Esther's ascension to the throne
  - Haman's plot to destroy all Jews throughout the kingdom
  - Esther's bold revelation of her Jewish identity before the king
  - The downfall of Haman and the salvation of the Jews

#### C. The Book of Jonah: A Reluctant Prophet

In contrast, the Book of Jonah presents a different perspective by depicting a reluctant prophet who is commissioned to carry a message to the people of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. When Jonah flees from God's service, he is swallowed by a huge fish and later preaches to the Ninevites, who repent and are spared.

- **Key Events:**
  - Jonah's commissioning as a prophet
  - His flight from God's service and subsequent swallowing by a fish
  - The preaching of Jonah to the people of Nineveh
  - The repentance and salvation of the Ninevites

#### D. Insights into Divinity and Theodicy

Both books offer insights into the Israelite concept of divinity and theodicy, grappling with the question of how faith in an essentially moral universe can be sustained in the face of evil and suffering.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - _Divine justice_ refers to God's role as a judge who punishes wrongdoing.
  - _Mercy_ refers to God's compassion and forgiveness towards humanity.
  - _Theodicy_ is the study of how faith can be sustained in the face of evil and suffering.

#### E. The Bible's Approach to Divinity

The Bible's approach is personal and spiritual, aiming to enable a relationship with God to survive all shocks, rather than providing a single model for coping with the problem of evil. The biblical writers presented various models of Israel's relationship with God, each serving a particular segment of the community and addressing a specific challenge at a given time.

- **Key Models:**
  - The Deuteronomist's emphasis on faithfulness despite defeat
  - The Psalms' expression of deep emotions and existential pleas for solace

#### F. Conclusion

The Books of Esther and Jonah offer unique insights into the human experience, from the heroic Jewish figure who saves his people through their own efforts to the reluctant prophet who learns that a change of heart can lead to mercy. These texts provide continued teaching and inspiration in the ever-changing moments of every age, reminding us that Israel's relationship with God has always been dynamic and complex.
