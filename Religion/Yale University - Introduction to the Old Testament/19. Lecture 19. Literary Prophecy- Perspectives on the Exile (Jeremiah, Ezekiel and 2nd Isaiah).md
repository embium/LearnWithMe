### I. The Book of Ezekiel: A Prophetic Literature on Reconciliation and Restoration
#### A. Historical Context and Purpose

The book of Ezekiel presents a prophetic literature that grapples with the aftermath of Jerusalem's destruction in the sixth century. Written by the prophet Ezekiel, who was deported to Babylon and witnessed the final destruction of Jerusalem, this literature addresses the question of how such evil could be reconciled with God's nature and Israel's status as God's elect.

#### B. Structure and Chronology

The book of Ezekiel follows a chronological order, with the first section consisting of oracles delivered before the destruction, and the latter part containing promises and visions for the future. This structure allows the reader to see the progression from judgment to hope, emphasizing individual responsibility for sin and rejecting the doctrine of collective punishment found in earlier biblical sources.

#### C. Key Themes: Individual Responsibility and Restoration

Ezekiel emphasizes that only the sinner will be punished, and God will no longer work through intergenerational guilt. In chapter 33, Ezekiel's message shifts from doom to hope, as he offers reassurance and promises a new beginning for Israel. The prophet uses metaphors of purity and cleansing, revival from death, and restoration to convey the idea that Israel can be reborn and renewed.

#### D. Visions of Restoration

Through his visions and prophecies, Ezekiel presents a complex and nuanced understanding of God's justice and mercy, highlighting the tension between divine sovereignty and human free will. A notable vision describes God promising to raise Israel from exile and restore her to her own land as one people with one prince to rule over her. This text has often been misinterpreted as speaking about literal resurrection after death, but in its context, it's clear that it's a metaphor for the redemption of the community from exile and the restoration of the people back in their own land.

#### E. The New Jerusalem

Ezekiel envisions a new Jerusalem at the center of the restored community, with a rebuilt temple and a river flowing from it to make the Dead Sea flow with fresh water again. He also sees Zadokite priests presiding over the Temple, assisted by Levites who are demoted in his vision.

### II. Post-Destruction Writings: A Shift in Perspective
#### A. Introduction

In contrast to Ezekiel's view that God would restore a purified Israel to its land under a Davidic monarchy, other post-destruction writings suggest that a relationship with God is possible outside of the chosen land. These writings emphasize monotheism, with Yahweh being the only real God who controls history and can use foreign nations for his purpose.

#### B. Second Isaiah: A New Perspective on Israel's Role

Second Isaiah contains famous Servant Songs that describe a servant figure who suffers on behalf of others, but whose mission to the world is more prominent. The identity of this servant has been debated among biblical interpreters, with some seeing it as an individual figure, while others see it as a collective figure representing Israel herself.

#### C. Universal Mission and Salvation

Second Isaiah emphasizes universal mission, with God making an eternal covenant with Israel to lead the nations of the world in his way. The institutions of the old order are transferred to the nation as a whole, and Israel is seen as a light unto the nations, from whom will come Torah, instruction in the divine will, and salvation.

#### D. Expansion of God's Purpose

This idea of universal mission comes out of Second Isaiah, and it's an expansion of God's purpose that appears in Isaiah 55:3-5. The concept of Israel as a light unto the nations and a source of salvation for the world marks a significant shift from Ezekiel's focus on restoration within the chosen land.

### III. Conclusion
The book of Ezekiel and post-destruction writings present two distinct perspectives on God's relationship with Israel and the world. While Ezekiel emphasizes individual responsibility, restoration, and the importance of the chosen land, Second Isaiah highlights universal mission, salvation, and the possibility of a relationship with God outside of the chosen land. These contrasting views offer a nuanced understanding of God's justice and mercy, highlighting the tension between divine sovereignty and human free will.
