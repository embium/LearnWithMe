### I. The Story of Moses' Return to Egypt
#### A. The Battle of Wills Between Pharaoh and God

The story of Moses' return to Egypt after the theophany at the burning bush sets in motion a battle of wills between Pharaoh and God. This contest is a common literary device, where "our boys are better than your boys," and ultimately leads to Yahweh's defeat of the Egyptian magicians, symbolizing the defeat of the gods of Egypt.

The ten plagues that follow include pollution of the Nile, swarms of frogs, lice, insects, affliction of livestock, boils that afflict humans and animals, lightning and hail, locusts, total darkness, and the death of the firstborn males of Egypt in one night. These plagues are a manifestation of God's power and authority over Pharaoh and the Egyptian gods.

#### B. The Sources of the Ten Plagues

Source critics analyze this material and discern diverse sources interwoven throughout, with no single source containing ten plagues. The final form of the text has been merged from these sources, resulting in a narrative that reiterates the motif of God's salvation from chaotic waters.

The story of the parting of the Reed Sea is celebrated as a historic memory of an escape from or defeat of Pharaoh, with the drowning image used metaphorically to describe the Egyptians' humiliation and defeat. This event became the paradigm of God's salvation of his people, referring to collective, communal salvation from national suffering and oppression.

### II. The Biblical Representation of Yahweh
#### A. Drawing from Cultural Context

The biblical representation of Yahweh employs language and images drawn from the traditions and myths of their broader cultural context, while differentiating themselves. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the Israelites' worldview and their relationship with God.

#### B. Differentiation from Other Cultures

However, it would be a mistake to view the Exodus as the climax of the preceding narrative, as the physical redemption of the Israelites is not in fact the end of the story. The covenant concluded at Sinai, referred to as the Mosaic covenant, differs radically from the Noahide and Abrahamic covenants.

### III. The Covenant at Sinai
#### A. Bilateral, Conditional Covenant

The Mosaic covenant is a bilateral, conditional covenant that requires obedience to laws and commandments, with God setting terms for protection and blessing towards Israel. If Israel doesn't fulfill her obligations, God will not fulfill his obligation of protection and blessing.

#### B. Historical-Critical Scholarship

Historical-critical scholarship has been unkind to biblical Israel due to biases between the Torah and the temple, leading scholars to emphasize the deliverance from Egypt as the high point in the Exodus narrative rather than the conclusion of the covenant at Mount Sinai.

### IV. The Tradition of Mount Zion
#### A. Jon Levenson's Perspective

Jon Levenson seeks to correct this prejudicial treatment by exploring the two great mountain traditions: the tradition of Mount Sinai, where Israel received the Torah, and the tradition of Mount Zion, which will be the future site of the nation's holy temple in Jerusalem.

### V. The Covenant Formulary
#### A. Ancient Near Eastern Parallels

Levenson stresses the importance of the covenant formulary, with Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the Sinai covenant found in Hittite treaties. He identifies six elements common to these treaties: a preamble, historical circumstances leading to the treaty, stipulations and requirements for the vassal, arrangement for publication or safe-keeping of the treaty, invocation of witnesses, and blessings for obedience and curses for violation.

#### B. The Lord's Speech to Moses

The Lord's speech to Moses in Exodus 19 includes many of these elements, setting the stage for the covenant bond between God and Israel. The concept of covenant is central to the Bible's portrayal of God's relationship with Israel.

### VI. The Book of Numbers
#### A. The Itinerary of the Israelites' Wanderings

The book of Numbers recounts the itinerary of the Israelites' wanderings and encampments around the sacred tabernacle, highlighting their constant complaining and rebellion against Moses and God. Despite God's offer to start anew with Moses, he defends the people before God, pleading for mercy when they deserve punishment.

#### B. The Paradigm of the Classical Prophet

This pattern is repeated throughout the book of Numbers, where Moses alternates between chastising the Israelites and consoling them, setting a paradigm for the classical prophet.
