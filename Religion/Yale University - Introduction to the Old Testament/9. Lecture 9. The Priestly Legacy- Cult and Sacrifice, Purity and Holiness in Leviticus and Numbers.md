### I. The Book of Leviticus: A Primary Document of the Priestly School
#### A. Overview of the Priestly Materials

The book of Leviticus is a primary document of the Priestly School, which deals with matters concerning priests and their jurisdiction over the sanctuary, cultic rituals, sacrifices, and distinctions between holy and profane things. The Priestly materials are found in Leviticus, Numbers, Genesis, and Exodus, and were produced by a Priestly School that emerged over centuries, reaching its final form in the exilic or post-exilic period. These materials often preserve older cultic traditions and priestly practices.

#### B. Structure of the Book of Leviticus

The book of Leviticus can be broken down into units that cover the sacrificial system (chapters 1-7), the installation of Aaron as high priest (chapters 8-10), dietary laws and ritual purity laws (chapters 11-15), and the Day of Atonement (chapter 16). The "Holiness Code" in chapters 17-26 is a block of material that comes from a different priestly school, designated as H.

#### C. Significance of the Priestly Materials

The Priestly materials have been devalued in scholarship for centuries, with many viewing impurity rules as primitive and irrational taboos. However, the work of anthropologists like Mary Douglas and biblical scholars like Jacob Milgrom and Jonathan Klawans has changed this perspective, showing that these rules are symbols conveying meaningful ideas to those who follow them.

### II. The Priestly Conception of Holiness
#### A. Definition of Holiness

The Priestly conception of holiness is rooted in the idea that only God is intrinsically holy, and that he can impart holiness to persons, places, and things through a specific kind of relationship. The holy is what is separated from common use, and only God's realm is considered holy.

#### B. Separation from Common Use

Common objects can become holy through dedication to God, but this requires separation from sources of impurity. This concept is central to the Priestly understanding of holiness and purity.

### III. The Priestly Construction of Purity Laws
#### A. Ritual Impurity

The Priestly writings in Leviticus 12-16 schematize Israelite purity practices as a system that differentiates Israel from her neighbors. Ritual impurity arises from physical substances and states not inherently sinful, such as corpses, certain carcasses, and genital discharges.

#### B. Contagious and Impermanent Impurity

This type of impurity is contagious, impermanent, and can defile sancta. The Priestly conception of god is an immortal and asexual being, and to enter the realm of the holy requires separation from death and procreation.

### IV. Sacrifices in the Priestly Tradition
#### A. Imitatio Dei

The concept of imitatio dei explains the practice of sacrifice as well, which involves controlled exercise of power over life and death, analogous to God's powers over human beings.

#### B. Attracting and Maintaining the Divine Presence

The Priestly traditions have two organizing principles regarding sacrifice: imitatio dei and a desire to attract and maintain the divine presence in the sanctuary. The ancient Israelites had a complex system of sacrifices and offerings to maintain their relationship with God and ensure his continued presence in their community.

### V. Moral Impurity and Atonement
#### A. Grave Sins

Moral impurity arose from the commission of heinous sins like idolatry, homicide, and sexual transgressions, and was not contagious or removable through rituals. It could only be achieved by punishment for heinous sins, avoiding defiling acts, or atoning for unwitting sins.

#### B. The Hatta't Sacrifice

The sanctuary could be purified of moral impurity through a special sacrifice called the hatta't, which involved the manipulation of animal blood to cleanse the sanctuary of impurities caused by sinful deeds.

### VI. The Priestly Construction of Israel's Purity Laws
#### A. Severing Impurity from the Demonic

The Priestly construction of Israel's purity laws aimed to sever impurity from the demonic and reinterpret it as a symbolic system reminding Israel of the divine imperative to reject sin and behave in ways that attract God's presence.

#### B. Forming and Maintaining a Differentiated Ethnic Identity

The dietary laws, which prohibited eating certain animals and emphasized reverence for life, served another important function: forming and maintaining a differentiated ethnic identity, marking Israel as God's holy people.

### VII. The Theme of Holiness in the Priestly Tradition
#### A. Israel as Holy People

The theme of holiness continued in the Holiness Code, where Israel itself was considered holy by virtue of being set apart from other nations to belong to God.

#### B. Human Role in Sanctification

Humans had a crucial role to play in sanctification, preserving the holy in its residence on earth through observance of rules and commandments that marked off Israel's status as distinct among the nations.
