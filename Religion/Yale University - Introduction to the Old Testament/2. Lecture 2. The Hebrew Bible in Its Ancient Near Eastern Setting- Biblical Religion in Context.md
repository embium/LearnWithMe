### I. Introduction to the Biblical Corpus
#### A. Overview of the Course's Approach

This course examines the biblical corpus from various perspectives and approaches, including historical, literary, religious, and cultural viewpoints. The Bible is analyzed as a product of a significant religious and cultural revolution that was shaped by the ideas and cultures of its time.

#### B. Historical Context of the Biblical Corpus

The first part of the Bible is seen as a product of this revolutionary period, where older traditions and stories were reinterpreted through the lens of monotheism. The final editors of the Bible, likely members of Israelite society's elite, imposed their specific worldview on these earlier narratives, resulting in a radical new perspective that emphasized the worship of one supreme God.

### II. Comparative Study with Ancient Near Eastern Literature
#### A. Shared Cultural and Literary Heritage

A comparative study with the literature of the Ancient Near East reveals both shared cultural and literary heritage between the two. However, significant differences also exist, highlighting the unique characteristics of the biblical corpus.

#### B. Evolution of Monotheism: A Break from Polytheism?

Initially, scholars viewed the evolution of monotheism as an advance over polytheism, with Israelite religion being a refined version of Ancient Near Eastern religions. However, this view was challenged by Yehezkel Kaufmann's argument that monotheism cannot evolve from polytheism due to fundamentally divergent worldviews and intuitions about reality.

### III. The Monotheistic Revolution: A Radical Break with Polytheism
#### A. Key Features of the Pagan Worldview

The pagan worldview, as characterized by Kaufman, features a metadivine realm that transcends gods, limiting their power and wisdom. Magic and divination in this system aim to tap into the ultimate source of power, rather than influencing the gods themselves.

#### B. Salvation through Magic or Gnostic Means

Salvation is achieved through magic or gnostic means, circumventing the capricious forces and powers in the world. In contrast, the monotheistic revolution posits a God who is himself the source of all being, not subject to a metadivine realm.

#### C. Implications of the Elimination of Mythology and Magic

The elimination of mythology, magic, and theogony presents an unlimited God who transcends nature, time, and space. This eliminates apotheosis, life after death, and the blurring of boundaries between humans and the divine.

### IV. The Hebrew Bible's View on Magic and Divination
#### A. Magic as Rebellion against God's Sovereignty

Magic is represented as useless in the Hebrew Bible, with power not inhering in natural substances or material things. Instead, magic is seen as rebellion against God's sovereignty, and its conceptions are often recast to emphasize God's will and power.

#### B. Divination: A Concept Incompatible with Monotheistic Ideas

The concept of divination in ancient cultures is often seen as incompatible with monotheistic ideas, as it implies the existence of a metadivine realm beyond God's control. However, Kaufman argues that this similarity is superficial and that Israelite religion transformed these phenomena by positing a supreme, transcendent God whose will is absolute.

### V. The Concept of Evil in Ancient Cultures
#### A. Attribution of Sin to Demons or Evil Gods

In contrast to pagan views, where sin is often attributed to demons or evil gods, Israelite thought conceives of evil as a result of humanity's rebellion against God's will, making it a moral rather than metaphysical reality.

#### B. Demythologization of Evil and Its Attribution to Human Beings

The Hebrew Bible presents a picture of a moral cosmos governed by God's absolute law, which imposes morality on the universe. Kaufman's work highlights the fundamental difference between Israelite monotheism and polytheistic thought, with the former positing a single, supreme God who is inherently good and just.

### VI. The Distinction Between Actual Religious Practices and Biblical Religion
#### A. Monolatry vs. Monotheism

The distinction between actual religious practices and beliefs of ancient Israelites (Israelite-Judean religion) and the worldview promoted by later writers and editors of biblical stories (biblical religion) is crucial to understanding the development of monotheistic thought in Israel.

#### B. The Emergence of Ethical Monotheism

While early Hebrews may have practiced monolatry, promoting the worship of one God without denying the existence of others, the most strongly monotheistic sources of the Bible posit a qualitatively different deity who is the source of all being and inherently good.

#### C. The Biblical Record: A Conflict between Non-Monotheistic and Monotheistic Views

The biblical record itself is conflicted, reflecting both non-monotheistic and monotheistic views, and biblical religion can be seen as a civil war of Israel against itself, breaking not only with Ancient Near Eastern practices but also with elements within their own society.
