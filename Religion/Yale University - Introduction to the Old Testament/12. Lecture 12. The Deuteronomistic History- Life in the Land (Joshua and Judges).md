### I. The Concept of Election in Deuteronomy
#### A. Introduction to God's Selection of Israel

The concept of election or choice in Deuteronomy refers to God's selection of Israel as a holy people, separated from the common and ordinary. This separation entails not only being distinct from other nations but also serving God through observance of his laws, rejection of pagan practices, and purity laws.

#### B. The Privilege and Obligations of Being Chosen

The privilege of being chosen comes with obligations and responsibilities, as seen in Deuteronomy's warnings against superiority complexes and boasting about Israel's election. Instead, the book emphasizes that Israel was chosen by Yahweh in an act of spontaneous love for the patriarchs, not due to their own merit or virtue.

#### C. The Theme of Election in Deuteronomy 7:6-8

This theme is echoed throughout the book, particularly in Deuteronomy 7:6-8, which states that God chose Israel because He favored them and kept the oath made to their fathers. The idea of election is closely tied to the concept of providential concern, as seen in Deuteronomy's emphasis on God's love and care for Israel.

#### D. The Image of Parent and Child

This image of parent and child is developed further by the prophet Hosea, who connects it to the theme of marriage and love. In contrast to the idea of election, the Priestly source (P) emphasizes a communal ethic, whereas post-exilic priests turned increasingly to an individual ethic.

### II. The Deuteronomistic School
#### A. Introduction to the Deuteronomistic History

The Deuteronomistic School, which includes Joshua through 2 Kings, assumes that Israel's residence in the land is a function of its obedience or disobedience to the covenant with Yahweh. This conviction colors their presentation and interpretation of Israel's history and kings, leading to a historiosophy that seeks to ascertain the meaning of events and draw larger philosophical conclusions from them.

#### B. Key Themes of the Deuteronomistic School

The Deuteronomistic School features several key themes, including:

*   The divine election of Jerusalem as the city where God will cause his name to dwell
*   The divine election of David as the king of Israel and his dynasty
*   The emphasis on Yahwist prophets like Elijah and Elisha who championed religious purity

### III. Geographical Setting of Ancient Israel
#### A. Introduction to the Geography of Ancient Israel

The geographical setting of ancient Israel is characterized by diverse regions, including the coastal plain, low mountains, and the Great Jordan Rift Valley.

#### B. The Great Jordan Rift Valley

This region is marked by a dramatic drop in elevation, with the Dead Sea being nearly 1300 feet below sea level, making it the lowest point on land. The area around the Sea is semi-desert, and tradition identifies this as the site of Sodom and Gomorrah.

#### C. Regional Diversity and Its Implications

Within this relatively small area, there are radically different regions, which held important implications for Israel's history, including unity and economic-cultural development.

### IV. The Book of Joshua
#### A. Introduction to the Book of Joshua

The Book of Joshua presents a streamlined account of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership, with Yahweh being the primary force behind their victories.

#### B. Archaeological Evidence and Its Contradictions

However, archaeological evidence contradicts this picture, suggesting that the formation of Israel was more complicated, involving gradual emergence, immigration, or revolt models.

#### C. Ritual Preparation and Purity in the Book of Joshua

The book of Joshua provides a different account from these models, emphasizing ritual preparation and purity over military skill, and claiming the utter destruction of the Canaanites when evidence points to close Canaanite origins.

### V. Conclusion
#### A. The Turning Point in 2 Kings

The Deuteronomistic history concludes with 2 Kings, marking a significant point in the narrative that sets the stage for the subsequent events and themes that unfold. This conclusion serves as a turning point, where the focus shifts from the unified kingdom of Israel to the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel, setting the stage for the complex and often tumultuous relationships between these two entities.
