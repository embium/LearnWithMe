### I. Psalms in the Hebrew Bible: Genres and Themes
#### A. Laments and Hymns

The psalms in the Hebrew Bible can be categorized into several genres, including laments and hymns. One type of lament is found in Psalm 44, which protests Israel's innocence and accuses God of negligence rather than guilt. This psalm is reminiscent of Job, where two conflicting viewpoints on suffering are presented: that there must be sin to explain the suffering, or that there is inexplicable suffering despite no wrongdoing.

In contrast, hymns like Psalms 78 and 106 celebrate divine action in Israel's history, following the Deuteronomistic line by stressing Israel's indebtedness to God and God's patience with their faithlessness. These two types of psalms are remarkably different, reflecting opposing views on Israel's relationship with God.

#### B. Blessing and Cursing

Another genre is that of blessing and cursing, where psalms invoke God to bless the righteous and punish the wicked. Psalm 137 is a shocking example of this type, calling for vengeance against the Babylonians who destroyed Jerusalem. The psalmist asks God to smite their foes with terrible afflictions, demonstrating a violent and vengeful tone.

#### C. Wisdom Psalms

Wisdom psalms have a reflective or meditative tone, praising instruction or Torah and meditation. Psalm 119 is an example of this type, representing Torah as an object of study and devotion that makes one wise and happy. The elevation of Torah reflects the shift in the Second Temple Period, where Torah became increasingly important.

### II. The Song of Songs
#### A. Genre and Interpretation

The Song of Songs, another poetic book in the Hebrew Bible, is a beautiful and erotic love song celebrating human sexuality and physical passion. It has been interpreted in various ways throughout Jewish tradition, with some seeing it as a metaphor for God's love for Israel or Christ's love for his bride.

#### B. Explicit Content

The book's explicit content has sometimes been toned down or interpreted away. Despite its provocative nature, the Song of Songs remains an important part of the Hebrew Bible and continues to be studied and debated by scholars and theologians today.

### III. Historical Background
#### A. The Babylonian Exile

The historical background of the Hebrew Bible includes the Babylonian exile, which lasted from 586 to 538 BCE. In 539 BCE, the Persian Empire was established under Cyrus, who conquered Babylon and allowed captives to return to their homelands and rebuild their temples.

#### B. The Return of the Exiles

The books of Ezra and Nehemiah give an account of the return of the Babylonian exiles in the late sixth and fifth century, with conflicting information about the timing of various events. The process of rebuilding was followed by social tensions within the Restoration community, particularly between those who had remained behind during the exile and the returning exiles.

#### C. Ezra's Reforms

Ezra, a Jewish subject of Persia, was appointed to supervise the temple and assess how well Mosaic standards were being implemented in the Judean province. He had the backing of the Persian empire to institute Mosaic Law as the standard and norm for the community in Jerusalem.

#### D. Nehemiah's Refortifications

Nehemiah, another Jewish subject of Persia, became the official cupbearer to Emperor Artaxerxes and traveled to Jerusalem to undertake the refortifications of the city. Despite opposition from internal and external forces, including a female prophetess named Noadiah, Nehemiah continued his work, establishing Jerusalem as an urban center and eventually becoming governor of Judah.

### IV. Social Tensions and Reforms
#### A. Ezra's Dissolution of Foreign Marriages

Ezra's most important acts were the dissolution of foreign marriages and the renewal of the covenant. He interpreted Mosaic prescriptions about marriage in an expansive way, prohibiting intermarriage with any foreigners, not just those who would lead Israelites into abhorrent pagan practices.

#### B. Ezra's Reforms and Legacy

Ezra's reforms aimed at preventing a repeat of Israel's tragic history, which he viewed as a cautionary tale. He believed that Israel had to live up to the covenant she failed to honor in the past and rededicate herself to God. Ezra and Nehemiah's efforts helped create and preserve a national and religious identity for Jews at a precarious time, but their reforms were not universally welcomed, and there was opposition from other groups within the Jewish community.

#### C. Legacy of Ezra and Nehemiah

The legacy of Ezra and Nehemiah continues to be felt today, as their reforms and leadership played a significant role in shaping the Jewish community during the Second Temple Period. Their efforts to establish a strong national and religious identity for Jews remain an important part of Jewish history and continue to influence Jewish thought and practice today.
