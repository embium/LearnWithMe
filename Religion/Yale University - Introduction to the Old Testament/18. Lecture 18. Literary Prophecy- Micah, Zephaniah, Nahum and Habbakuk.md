### I. The Southern Prophets and the Assyrian Crisis
#### A. Micah: A Prophet of Condemnation and Hope

Micah was a rural prophet from Moreshet near Jerusalem who prophesied against Israel's idolatries and condemned the kingdom's leaders for their moral failings. He sharply criticized the Davidic dynasty and ridiculed the idea of Zion's inviolability, stating that God would destroy his city and house if need be.

Micah 3:9-12 declares, "Hear this, you rulers of the House of Jacob... Her rulers judge for gifts, Her priests give rulings for a fee..." The passage concludes with the promise that Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins. In contrast to Isaiah's trust in God's protection of Zion, Micah emphasizes that God's presence is not a guarantee of safety.

Micah also refers to the Babylonian exile and the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, which may indicate late editorial interpolations. The book structurally alternates between prophecies of doom and restoration or hope, with the latter passages telling of Zion's future glory. Some scholars suggest that these restoration passages were interpolated by a later editor, but this is not necessarily the case.

#### B. Micah's Covenant Lawsuit

One of the most famous passages in Micah is chapter 6:8, which takes the form of a covenant lawsuit and summons Israel to present its case before God. The prophet appeals to Israel's memory of God's great love for her, citing the exodus and entry into the Promised Land. However, Israel's conduct in response to this benevolence is appalling.

Micah's message emphasizes that God's presence is not a guarantee of safety, and that Israel must respond to God's love with justice and morality. The prophet appeals to Israel's memory of God's great love for her, citing the exodus and entry into the Promised Land.

#### C. Micah's Prophecies of Doom and Restoration

Micah's prophecies alternate between doom and restoration or hope, with the latter passages telling of Zion's future glory. Some scholars suggest that these restoration passages were interpolated by a later editor, but this is not necessarily the case.

### II. Zephaniah: A Prophet of Pessimism and Hope
#### A. Zephaniah's Prophecies

Zephaniah prophesied during King Josiah's reign and his prophecies seem to date back before Josiah's reforms in 622 BC. His messages are very pessimistic and grim, condemning Judah for apostasy and decadence.

Zephaniah declares that God will bring universal destruction, exterminating all life, animal and human. However, he also offers hope, stating that a humble remnant will seek refuge in God and be delivered from their oppressors.

#### B. Zephaniah's Message of Hope

Despite the pessimistic tone of his prophecies, Zephaniah offers hope to those who seek refuge in God. He declares that a humble remnant will be delivered from their oppressors and find salvation in God.

### III. The Book of Nahum: A Celebration of the Fall of Nineveh
#### A. The Fall of Nineveh

The Book of Nahum celebrates the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC, the capital of the cruel Assyrian empire. The prophet rejoices over the avenging and wrathful God who has finally turned against this terrible enemy of Israel and the world.

Nahum's poetic style is vivid and exciting, describing armed legions marching against Nineveh and plundering its treasure. The Book of Nahum emphasizes the power and justice of God in bringing down the Assyrian empire.

#### B. Nahum's Message

Nahum's message emphasizes the power and justice of God in bringing down the Assyrian empire. He celebrates the fall of Nineveh as a triumph of God over evil and oppression.

### IV. The Book of Habakkuk: A Prophet's Struggle with God
#### A. Habakkuk's Complaints

The Book of Habakkuk was written during the period when the Babylonians attacked Jerusalem twice. This prophetic book contains philosophical musings on God's behavior, with the prophet complaining bitterly about God's inaction.

Habakkuk struggles with what appears to be a basic lack of justice, where the wicked seem to fare better than the just. He awaits God's answer and receives a response that the righteous will be rewarded with life for their fidelity.

#### B. Habakkuk's Response

Habakkuk's response emphasizes the importance of faith and trust in God's justice. Despite his struggles with God's behavior, he ultimately trusts in God's power to bring about justice and redemption.

### V. The Book of Jeremiah: A Prophet's Message of Doom and Hope
#### A. Jeremiah's Prophecies

The prophet Jeremiah lived at the time of the final destruction of Judah in 587 BC and saw the fall of Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians. He was born into a priestly family in a village near Jerusalem, Anathoth, and began prophesying while still a boy.

Jeremiah's message is one of impending doom and destruction for Israel due to its violation of the covenant. He denounces leaders, professional prophets, and priests, criticizing King Jehoiakim and attacking the idea of Zion's inviolability.

#### B. Jeremiah's Message of Hope

Despite his message of doom, Jeremiah also offers hope to those who seek refuge in God. He writes that God will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah, putting His Teaching into their inmost being and inscribing it upon their hearts.

### VI. The Legacy of the Southern Prophets
#### A. The Contribution of the Prophets

The great contribution of the prophets was their emphasis on God's desire for morality as expressed in the ancient covenant. Jeremiah's insistence on God's everlasting covenant with his people, even outside the land of Israel, provided the exiles with ideas that would transform the nation of Israel into the religion of Judaism.

#### B. The Impact of the Prophets

The prophets helped some Israelites make sense of their situation, claiming that Yahweh hadn't been defeated and the nation's calamities were proof of His power and covenant. Their emphasis on God's desire for morality as expressed in the ancient covenant provided a foundation for the development of Judaism.

#### C. The Significance of the Prophets

The southern prophets played a significant role in shaping Israelite identity and culture, emphasizing the importance of morality and justice in God's eyes. Their prophecies continue to inspire and guide people today, offering hope and comfort in times of crisis and uncertainty.
